In spite of the increasing use of Twitter services by students and instructors in colleges, very little empirical studies that concern the impact of social media on the student learning environment have been published. In this paper, a Twitter utilization experiment is conducted for college classes to understand the effects on college student engagement and grades. The participants of experimental study comprise students of 2 college classes during one semester and only voluntary students attend this Twitter-based experiment. Network of Twitter using pattern such as community building, collaboration relationship and information sharing among students are analyzed. Some results about the relationships of seat positions, following patterns and grades among students have been studied. Through understanding of the student’s netwoking pattern, we find that the possibility of Twitter as a mobile educational tool.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an exploratory investigation of global scale diversity and inclusion efforts within engineering education. Diversity and Inclusion (D\&I) are contextualized topics that shift objectives from country to country. The role of D\&I in engineering education and practice has gained prominence in recent years due to the fact that engineers are facing increased need for global collaborations and are expected to be able to work in highly diverse teams and within different cultures. D\&I initiatives in the field of engineering generally include gender, ethnicity, and national origin, and may include persons who are economically underprivileged and persons with disabilities. While the prominence of D\&I has increased, international learning outcomes and collaborations within these efforts are limited. Within a global community a common platform would allow for the sharing of best practices and maximize learning opportunities. From a research and evaluation perspective, much work has been conducted and disseminated in the United States and could serve as transferable models for these efforts. By examining models from around the world, we can begin to consolidate, optimize, and disseminate the global benefits of D\&I. In this work, various programs are reviewed as success cases because they have increased the numbers of underrepresented students who enroll in and graduate from STEM programs. The potential for solidarity amongst diversity \& inclusion initiatives and programs in different regions of the world is explored. Efforts are made to determine what can be learned from synergies across D\&I activities.},

	volume = {4},
	abstract = {Through the use of service learning in higher education, universities hope to both provide real benefit to the partnering community and allow students to develop a greater understanding of course curriculum, their discipline, and their personal positioning within society. Through these educational activities, service learning seeks to engage students in critical thinking processes while simultaneously achieving a greater sense of civic and social responsibility through targeted participation in meaningful community service activities. However, in practice, service learning can take a variety of forms predicated on technical, cultural, societal, and political constraints. Thus, while some work shows positive effects on students’ attitudes, social behaviour, and academic performance, less research has demonstrated long-term community impact. Nor has much research shown that participation in service learning has a long-term impact on students' ethical perspectives and frameworks, and whether those ethical frames carry on to their professional careers. Moreover, as institutions partner with such humanitarian service groups as Engineers Without Borders USA, we know considerably less about the institutional cultures and climates that are developed through such partnerships and how sustainable they are, given those inherent technical, political and cultural limitations. As a first step towards these goals, this paper proposes a methodology for investigating the impacts of service learning activities on both the students and communities involved.},

	abstract = {Background

Engineers must acquire increasing technical and professional skills to meet pressing global challenges, but fitting training for these skills into already crowded curricula is difficult. Engineering service may provide opportunities to gain such skills; however, prior research about learning outcomes from such activities has been primarily small-scale, anecdotal, or lacking a comparison group.


Purpose/Hypothesis

We aim to understand whether self-reported learning outcomes differ between engineers involved and not involved with engineering service activities. Specifically, do the two groups experience and learn different technical and professional skills in their engineering activities?


Design/Method

We used a sequential mixed methods approach that began with interviews and focus groups with 165 participants and continued with a questionnaire administered to over 2,500 engineering students and practicing engineers both involved and not involved with engineering service. Analyses included variable-oriented qualitative analysis and multiple linear regression models to compare perceived technical and professional skills.


Results

Quantitative results show that engineers involved and not involved with engineering service report comparable perceived technical skills, and that those involved in engineering service report significantly higher perceived professional skills, even when controlling for age, gender, and grade point average. Qualitative results indicate that higher professional skills can be partially attributed to the realistic, complex, and contextualized learning experiences within engineering service activities.


Conclusions

Engineers involved with engineering service may gain strong professional engineering skills that do not compromise their technical skills. Thus, engineering service may help educate the type of engineers the field needs to confront pressing global challenges.},

	abstract = {Background

Socially engaged engineering activities such as community development have grown rapidly in popularity. The engineers who participate in these activities seem more diverse and more broadly interested than the larger population of engineers in the United States.


Purpose/Hypothesis

This article compares the personal attributes, specifically personality traits and motivations to study engineering, of members of a prominent engineering service organization, Engineers Without Borders (EWB-USA), with the attributes of engineers who were not members.


Design/Method

Using an exploratory, sequential mixed methods approach that combined variable-oriented analysis of interviews and focus groups with multiple logistic regression models from responses to a national survey, we compared engineers' personality traits and motivations to study engineering.


Results

Results indicate that both EWB-USA members and nonmembers exhibit strong personality traits for conscientiousness and emotional stability. Both members and nonmembers have similar intrinsic engineering interests and motivations. EWB-USA members have significantly stronger personality traits for openness to experience and agreeableness, stronger motivations for social good, and broader interests than do nonmembers.


Conclusions

EWB-USA members have personal attributes that match those of other engineers, but they have broader interests and motivations than do other engineers. These differences suggest including socially engaged engineering activities in engineering may increase the number and broaden the diversity of engineering students and practitioners.},

	abstract = {At a time when social media is being increasingly used by students, there appears to be an expectation that it should also be used for educational purposes. The aim of this exploratory case study is to investigate the perceptions of undergraduate accounting students using Twitter as a learning support tool. The literature suggests the use of Twitter supports a range of communication functions as well as pedagogic functions. Although there have been few studies, the educational literature is generally positive about the use of Twitter, whereas there is an emerging non-educational literature about the operational aspects of Twitter which provides evidence of potential limitations in its educational use. This study provided students with a range of experiences using Twitter as a learning support tool. The students involved offered a range of perceptions about its value in supporting accounting education. Overall, this exploratory study demonstrates the relatively complex perceptions of accounting students about using Twitter. It is concluded that while Twitter has some communication and pedagogic potential, educators should plan its use carefully in the context of its limitations and operating dynamics. As a result educators should expect some unpredictability in students' motivation and varying support for its use.},

Within this context, this article has two goals: first, it positions ETH programs within a history of the U.S. engineering profession generally. We argue that the emergence of ETH programs represents a shift in how some engineers and engineering educators are re-imagining and re-framing their profession and engineering education from a constraining concept of "service" to include a broader notion of "helping." Second, we want to question the notion of "helping" as a defining framework for ETH initiatives. Engineering students and faculty, though well-intentioned and motivated by altruism, should be aware of significant critiques from fields such as development studies, feminist critical theory, and cultural studies. These critiques may both challenge and enrich theoretical frameworks used by ETH practitioners, and guide future practice. We provide only a broad introduction to these frameworks here, but we hope that this work will serve as a springboard for further inquiry, reflection, and reform.},

Mean effects ranged from 0.27 to 0.43. Furthermore, as predicted, there was empirical support for the position that following certain recommended practices—such as linking to curriculum, voice, community involvement, and reflection—was associated with better outcomes.

It also includes a brief review of the recent advancements in incorporating active learning approaches into quantitative biology classrooms. We begin with an overview of recent literature that shows that active learning can improve students’ outcomes in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Education disciplines. We then discuss how this approach can be particularly useful when teaching topics in quantitative biology. Next, we describe some of the recent initiatives to develop hands-on activities in quantitative biology at both the graduate and the undergraduate levels. Throughout the article we provide resources for educators who wish to integrate active learning and technology into their classrooms.},

large virtual department of colleagues that can help to
rapidly generate, share and refine new ideas. As ideas
become manuscripts, Twitter can be used as an informal
arena for the pre-review of works in progress. Finally,
tweeting published findings can communicate research
to a broad audience of other researchers, decision makers,
journalists and the general public that can amplify
the scientific and social impact of publications. However,
there are limitations, largely surrounding issues of
intellectual property and ownership, inclusiveness and
misrepresentations of science ‘sound bites’. Nevertheless,

Respondents reported intense and multifaceted utilization of the service, with professional development (PD) uses more common than interactions with students or families. Educators valued Twitter's personalized, immediate nature, and the positive and collaborative community it facilitated. Many cited Twitter's role in combating various types of isolation and described it as superior to traditional professional development.

In each sequence, the first course gives students most of the basic tools they will need and the second is centered on an electromechanical Rube Goldberg design project, undertaken by the whole class. Students develop the design concept, build the system, and prove that it works. They are able to practice skills such as communications, teamwork, time management, and experimentation. The integrated first-year course sequences have been offered for two years and have proved successful. The students were clearly satisfied with their experience.},

	abstract = {When walking in open space, collision avoidance with other pedestrians is a process that successfully takes place many times. To pass another pedestrian (an interferer) walking direction, walking speed or both can be adjusted. Currently, the literature is not yet conclusive of how humans adjust these two parameters in the presence of an interferer. This impedes the development of models predicting general obstacle avoidance strategies in humans’ walking behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate the adjustments of path and speed when a pedestrian is crossing a non-reactive human interferer at different angles and speeds, and to compare the results to general model predictions. To do so, we designed an experiment where a pedestrian walked a 12 m distance to reach a goal position. The task was designed in such a way that collision with an interferer would always occur if the pedestrian would not apply a correction of movement path or speed. Results revealed a strong dependence of path and speed adjustments on crossing angle and walking speed, suggesting local planning of the collision avoidance strategy. Crossing at acute angles (i.e. 45° and 90°) seems to require more complex collision avoidance strategies involving both path and speed adjustments than crossing at obtuse angles, where only path adjustments were observed. Overall, the results were incompatible with predictions from existing models of locomotor collision avoidance. The observed initiations of both adjustments suggest a collision avoidance strategy that is temporally controlled. The present study provides a comprehensive picture of human collision avoidance strategies in walking, which can be used to evaluate and adjust existing pedestrian dynamics models, or serve as an empirical basis to develop new models.},

A consistent analysis over diverse student populations in high schools, colleges, and universities is obtained if a rough measure of the average effectiveness of a course in promoting conceptual understanding is taken to be the average normalized gain 〈g〉. The latter is defined as the ratio of the actual average gain (\%〈 post 〉−\%〈 pre 〉) to the maximum possible average gain (100−\%〈 pre 〉). Fourteen “traditional” (T) courses (N=2084) which made little or no use of interactive-engagement (IE) methods achieved an average gain 〈g〉 T- ave =0.23±0.04 (std dev) . In sharp contrast, 48 courses (N=4458) which made substantial use of IE methods achieved an average gain 〈g〉 IE-ave =0.48±0.14 (std dev) , almost two standard deviations of 〈g〉 IE-ave above that of the traditional courses. Results for 30 (N=3259) of the above 62 courses on the problem-solving Mechanics Baseline test of Hestenes–Wells imply that IE strategies enhance problem-solving ability. The conceptual and problem-solving test results strongly suggest that the classroom use of IE methods can increase mechanics-course effectiveness well beyond that obtained in traditional practice.},

We explain how feedback is inherent in and a prime determiner of processes that constitute SRL, and review areas of research that elaborate contemporary models of how feedback functions in learning. Specifically, we begin by synthesizing a model of self-regulation based on contemporary educational and psychological literatures. Then we use that model as a structure for analyzing the cognitive processes involved in self-regulation, and for interpreting and integrating findings from disparate research traditions. We propose an elaborated model of SRL that can embrace these research findings and that spotlights the cognitive operation of monitoring as the hub of self-regulated cognitive engagement. The model is then used to reexamine (a) recent research on how feedback affects cognitive engagement with tasks and (b) the relation among forms of engagement and achievement. We conclude with a proposal that research on feedback and research on self-regulated learning should be tightly coupled, and that the facets of our model should be explicitly addressed in future research in both areas.},

Here, the authors show that when correct responses are made with low confidence, feedback serves to correct this initial metacognitive error, enhancing retention of low-confidence correct responses. In 2 experiments, subjects took an initial multiple-choice test on general knowledge facts and made a confidence judgment after each response. Feedback was provided for half of the questions, and retention was assessed by a final cued-recall test. Taking the initial test improved retention relative to not testing, and feedback further enhanced performance. Consistent with prior research, feedback improved retention by allowing subjects to correct initially erroneous responses. Of more importance, feedback also doubled the retention of correct low-confidence responses, relative to providing no feedback. The function of feedback is to correct both memory errors and metacognitive errors.},

Current views of learning and instruction challenge the wisdom of this traditional pedagogic practice by stressing the need for the learner to play an active role in constructing knowledge. The emerging technology of classroom communication systems offers a promising tool for helping instructors create a more interactive, student-centered classroom, especially when teaching large courses. In this paper we describe our experiences teaching physics with a classroom communication system calledClasstalk. Classtalk facilitated the presentation of questions for small group work as well as the collection of student answers and the display of histograms showing how the class answered, all of which fed into a class-wide discussion of students’ reasoning. We foundClasstalk to be a useful tool not only for engaging students in active learning during the lecture hour but also for enhancing the overall communication within the classroom. Equally important, students were very positive aboutClasstalk-facilitated instruction and believed that they learned more during class than they would have during a traditional lecture.},

Combining a traditional lecture/recitation format with secure, online tests, we have raised our expectations for students and improved student performance, while increasing the fraction of students who succeed, especially underrepresented minorities and women. We call the instructional approach ldquoMasteryrdquo, because students continue to work on a topic until they earn a perfect score on the corresponding test. Further, it shows great promise for transforming undergraduate education, especially those courses that provide foundational skills and prepare students for future learning. The approach could have a positive impact on the retention rates of all students and even greater impact on those for underrepresented groups. In this paper, we describe the Mastery approach and its implementation over the past two years. We also show the current state of passing and completion rates as compared to those rates before Mastery was introduced. Finally, we discuss a range of issues, including the appropriateness of the Mastery approach for other courses.},

reporting in which scores are attached to the specific learning objectives of a
course, rather than to assignments or tests. Each score represents a student’s
mastery of that learning objective, and may change over time in response to
evidence that her level of understanding has changed. SBG is increasingly
popular in K-12 education, but has been poorly documented and studied in a
university context. I explored the practicality and effects of using SBG in a
moderately large university class by incorporating it into the two successive
courses of an introductory physics sequence. Although design flaws and logistical
difficulties plagued these attempts, most students responded positively to the basic
intent and elements of the approach. Our experiences revealed likely
implementation errors and suggested some wise design choices. More
interestingly, I found that SBG foregrounds and forces us to confront some
fundamental tensions present but latent within most or all teaching.},

This paper describes our semester-long experimental study to determine if using Twitter – the microblogging and social networking platform most amenable to ongoing, public dialogue – for educationally relevant purposes can impact college student engagement and grades. A total of 125 students taking a first year seminar course for pre-health professional majors participated in this study (70 in the experimental group and 55 in the control group). With the experimental group, Twitter was used for various types of academic and co-curricular discussions. Engagement was quantified by using a 19-item scale based on the National Survey of Student Engagement. To assess differences in engagement and grades, we used mixed effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) models, with class sections nested within treatment groups. We also conducted content analyses of samples of Twitter exchanges. The ANOVA results showed that the experimental group had a significantly greater increase in engagement than the control group, as well as higher semester grade point averages. Analyses of Twitter communications showed that students and faculty were both highly engaged in the learning process in ways that transcended traditional classroom activities. This study provides experimental evidence that Twitter can be used as an educational tool to help engage students and to mobilize faculty into a more active and participatory role.},

Students were tasked with applying the principles of fundamental static equilibrium analysis to objects found in their normal surroundings. The deliverable for this assignment consisted of a photograph of an object they found to be in static equilibrium and a short description of how the state of the object could be described mathematically. Student submissions for this task exhibited a wide range of quality and imagination. Examples of student work are presented along with discussion of lessons learned and recommendations for the use of this method in the future. The overall student response to this task was positive and thus these efforts will be expanded.},

	abstract = {We investigate the electromechanical side instability and the stable travel range of comb-drive actuators. The stable travel range depends on the finger gap spacing, the initial finger overlap, and the spring stiffness ratio of the compliant suspension. Proper design of the suspension structure is the most effective way to stabilize the actuator and therefore to achieve a large deflection. In this paper, we propose an improved suspension design, the so-called tilted folded-beam suspension. Using such suspension, the stability of the comb-drive actuator is improved and the stable travel range is enhanced. We give the expressions for the spring constants of the proposed suspension, both in the stroke direction and perpendicular to it. The suspension designs are also studied numerically using the finite element method (FEM), in which the geometric nonlinearities, such as large deflections and stress stiffening, are considered. Analytical calculations and FEM simulations are compared. The results demonstrate that an enhanced stable travel range, compared to that of a comb-drive actuator with the most commonly used folded-beam flexure, can be achieved by using the proposed suspension design. Comb-drive actuators with various tilted folded-beam suspensions have also been fabricated using the standard surface micromachining technology and their operational performances have been characterized. The experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions.},

	abstract = {High-performance robust motion control of single-rod hydraulic actuators with constant unknown inertia load is considered. The two chambers of a single-rod actuator have different areas, so the dynamic equations describing the pressure changes in them cannot be combined into a single load pressure equation. This complicates controller design since it not only increases the system dimension but also brings in the stability issue of the added internal dynamics. A discontinuous projection-based adaptive robust controller (ARC) is constructed. The controller takes into account not only the effect of parameter variations coming from the inertia load and various hydraulic parameters but also the effect of hard-to-model nonlinearities such as uncompensated friction forces and external disturbances. It guarantees a prescribed output tracking transient performance and final tracking accuracy in general while achieving asymptotic output tracking in the presence of parametric uncertainties. In addition, the zero error dynamics for tracking any nonzero constant velocity trajectory is shown to be globally uniformly stable. Experimental results are obtained for the swing motion control of a hydraulic arm and verify the high-performance nature of the proposed strategy. In comparison to a state-of-the-art industrial motion controller, the proposed algorithm achieves more than a magnitude reduction of tracking errors. Furthermore, during the constant velocity portion of the motion, it reduces the tracking errors almost down to the measurement resolution level},

	abstract = {Surgical and search/rescue robots often work in environments with very strict spatial constraints. The tendon-sheath mechanism is a promising candidate for driving such systems, allowing power sources and actuation motors placed outside to transmit force and energy to the robot at the distal end through the constrained environment. Having both compactness and high force capability makes it very attractive for manipulation devices. On the other hand, the friction attenuation of tendon tension is nonlinear and configuration-dependent due to tendon/sheath interactions throughout the transmission path. This is a major obstacle for the tendon-sheath mechanism to be widely adopted. Here, we focus on the friction analysis for flexible and time-varying tendon-sheath configurations: the most challenging but yet commonly encountered case for real-world applications. Existing results on fixed-path configurations are reviewed, revisited, and extended to flexible and time-varying cases. The effect of tendon length to friction attenuation is modeled. While focusing on tension transmission, tendon elongation is also discussed with the length effect applied. In the end, two-dimensional results are extended to three-dimensional tendon-sheath configurations. All propositions and theorems are validated on a dedicated experimental platform.},

	abstract = {Design and analysis of piezoelectric actuators having over 20\% effective strain using an exponential strain amplification mechanism are presented in this paper. Piezoelectric ceramic material, such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT), has large stress and bandwidth, but its extremely small strain, i.e., only 0.1\%, has been a major bottleneck for broad applications. This paper presents a new strain amplification design, called a â€ nested rhombusâ€ multilayer mechanism, that increases strain exponentially through its hierarchical cellular structure. This allows for over 20\% effective strain. In order to design the whole actuator structure, not only the compliance of piezoelectric material but also the compliance of the amplification structures needs to be taken into account. This paper addresses how the output force and displacement are attenuated by the compliance involved in the strain amplification mechanism through kinematic and static analysis. An insightful lumped parameter model is proposed to quantify the performance degradation and facilitate design tradeoffs. A prototype-nested PZT cellular actuator that weighs only 15 g has produced 21\% effective strain (2.5 mm displacement from 12-mm actuator length and 30 mm width) and 1.7 N blocking force.},

Thus, robotics specialists are interested in this well-adapted artificial muscle for motorizing powerful yet compact robot arms.

	abstract = {Flexible endoscope-based endoluminal and transgastric surgery for cholecystectomy, appendectomy, bariatric, and antireflux procedures show promise as a less invasive form of surgery. Current endoscopes and instruments are inadequate to perform such complex surgeries for a variety of reasons: they are too flexible and are insufficient to provide robust grasping and anatomic retraction. The lack of support for a retroflexed endoscope in the peritoneal cavity makes it hard to reach remote structures and makes vigorous retraction of tissues and organs difficult. There is also a need for multiple channels in scopes to allow use of several instruments and to provide traction/countertraction. Finally, secure means of tissue approximation are critical. The aim was to develop and test a new articulating flexible endoscopic system for endoluminal and transgastric endosurgery. A multidisciplinary group of gastrointestinal physicians and surgeons worked with medical device engineers to develop new devices and instruments. Needs assessments and design parameters were developed by consensus. Prototype devices were tested using inanimate models until usable devices were arrived at. The devices were tested in nonsurvival pigs and dogs. The devices were accessed through an incision in the wall of the stomach and manipulated in the peritoneal cavity to accomplish four different tasks: right upper quadrant wedge liver biopsy, right lower quadrant cecal retraction, left lower quadrant running small bowel, and left lower quadrant exposure of esophageal hiatus. In another three pigs, transgastric cholecystectomy was attempted. The positions of the device, camera, and endosurgical instruments, with and without ShapeLock technology, were recorded using laparoscopy and endoscopy and procedure times and success rates were measured. Instrument design parameters and their engineering solutions are described. Flexible multilumen guides which could be locked in position, including a prototype which allowed triangulation, were constructed. Features of the 18-mm devices include multidirectional mid body and/or tip angulation, two 5.5-mm accessory channels allowing the use of large (5-mm) flexible endosurgical instruments, as well as a 4-mm channel for an ultraslim prototype video endoscope (Pentax 4 mm). Using the resulting devices, the four designated transgastric procedures were performed in anesthetized animals. One hundred percent of the transgastric endosurgical procedures were accomplished with the exception of a 50\% success for hiatal exposure, a 90\% success rate for wedge liver biopsy, and a 33.3\% success rate for cholecystectomy. A new endosurgical multilumen device and advanced instrumentation allowed effective transgastric exploration and procedures in the abdominal cavity including retraction of the liver and stomach to allow exposure of the gallbladder, retraction of the cecum, manipulation of the small bowel, and exposure of the esophageal hiatus. This technology may serve as the needed platform for transgastric cholecystectomy, gastric reduction, fundoplication, hiatus hernia repair, or other advanced endosurgical procedures.},

	abstract = {A 3D gyroscope provides measurements of angular velocities around its three intrinsic orthogonal axes, enabling angular orientation estimation. Because the measured angular velocities represent simultaneous rotations, it is not appropriate to consider them sequentially. Rotations in general are not commutative, and each possible rotation sequence has a different resulting angular orientation. None of these angular orientations is the correct simultaneous rotation result. However, every angular orientation can be represented by a single rotation. This paper presents an analytic derivation of the axis and angle of the single rotation equivalent to three simultaneous rotations around orthogonal axes when the measured angular velocities or their proportions are approximately constant. Based on the resulting expressions, a vector called the simultaneous orthogonal rotations angle (SORA) is defined, with components equal to the angles of three simultaneous rotations around coordinate system axes. The orientation and magnitude of this vector are equal to the equivalent single rotation axis and angle, respectively. As long as the orientation of the actual rotation axis is constant, given the SORA, the angular orientation of a rigid body can be calculated in a single step, thus making it possible to avoid computing the iterative infinitesimal rotation approximation. The performed test measurements confirm the validity of the SORA concept. SORA is simple and well-suited for use in the real-time calculation of angular orientation based on angular velocity measurements derived using a gyroscope. Moreover, because of its demonstrated simplicity, SORA can also be used in general angular orientation notation.},

This study aimed to measure the amount this new platform would improve performance for bimanual coordination compared with a standard dual-channel scope using a benchtop simulation. Methods\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Task 1 involved 12 individuals performing an identical bimanual coordination task with two different devices: a dual-channel endoscope (DCE) and the EndoSAMURAI prototype. The participants were separated into three groups with different levels of endoscopy and NOTES experience. A complex bimanual coordination task (pin transfer) was used. For this task, 12 pins had to be manipulated in a predetermined order. Performance was measured by movement speed, and accuracy. Comparisons were made between the two devices and the three groups of subjects. Task 2 required the same 12 participants to perform a standardized intracorporeal suture in a NOTES simulation. Results\&nbsp;\&nbsp;In the pin transfer task, overall performance speed was significantly faster using the EndoSAMURAI (304 Â± 125\&nbsp;s) rather than the DCE (867 Â± 312\&nbsp;s; P \&lt; 0.001). The difference between the two operating systems was more pronounced in the student group than in the surgeon group: experts (226 Â± 41 vs. 620 Â± 277\&nbsp;s), surgeons (333 Â± 152 vs. 930 Â± 283\&nbsp;s), students (318 Â± 83 vs. 1021 Â± 423\&nbsp;s). Accuracy, as indicated by the number of pin drops, also was significantly better using the EndoSAMURAI (0.4) rather than the DCE (1.8 drops; P = 0.006). In addition, all 12 participants were able to complete a suture using the EndoSAMURAI, but none could complete a suture using the DCE. Conclusions\&nbsp;\&nbsp;The EndoSAMURAI enhances performance times and accuracy in complex surgical tasks compared with the conventional therapeutic endoscope.},

	abstract = {Background As surgical robots begin to occupy a larger place in operating rooms around the world, continued innovation is necessary to improve our outcomes. Methods A comprehensive review of current surgical robotic user interfaces was performed to describe the modern surgical platforms, identify the benefits, and address the issues of feedback and limitations of visualization. Results Most robots currently used in surgery employ a master/slave relationship, with the surgeon seated at a work-console, manipulating the master system and visualizing the operation on a video screen. Although enormous strides have been made to advance current technology to the point of clinical use, limitations still exist. A lack of haptic feedback to the surgeon and the inability of the surgeon to be stationed at the operating table are the most notable examples. The future of robotic surgery sees a marked increase in the visualization technologies used in the operating room, as well as in the robots' abilities to convey haptic feedback to the surgeon. This will allow unparalleled sensation for the surgeon and almost eliminate inadvertent tissue contact and injury. Conclusions A novel design for a user interface will allow the surgeon to have access to the patient bedside, remaining sterile throughout the procedure, employ a head-mounted three-dimensional visualization system, and allow the most intuitive master manipulation of the slave robot to date.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the clinical motivation, design specifications, kinematics, statics, and actuation compensation for a newly constructed telerobotic system for Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) of the throat. A hybrid dual-arm telesurgical slave, with twenty joint-space Degrees of Freedom (DoF), is used in this telerobotic system to provide the necessary dexterity in deep surgical fields such as the throat. The telerobotic slave uses novel continuum robots that use multiple super-elastic backbones for actuation and structural integrity. The paper presents the kinematics of the telesurgical slave and methods for actuation compensation to cancel the effects of backlash, friction, and flexibility of the actuation lines. A method for actuation compensation is presented in order to overcome uncertainties of modeling, friction, and backlash. This method uses a tiered hierarchy of two novel approaches of actuation compensation for remotely actuated snake-like robots. The tiered approach for actuation compensation uses compensation in both joint space and configuration space of the continuum robots. These actuation hybrid compensation schemes use intrinsic model information and external data through a recursive linear estimation algorithm and involve compensation using configuration space and joint space variables. Experimental results validate the ability of our integrated telemanipulation system through experiments of suturing and knot tying in confined spaces.},

Previously reported designs require very narrow air gaps of 3Â Î¼m at structural heights of up to 1Â mm [K. Fischer, H. Guckel, Long throw linear magnetic actuators stackable to one millimeter of structural height, Microsyst. Technol., 4 (1998) 180â€“183] which makes them sensitive to operate, and challenging to fabricate. The new design reduces the reluctance by a parallel connection and cascading of several pole shoes as is well known for electrostatic actuators. This reduces the current consumption and linearizes the currentâ€“displacement characteristic. The cascaded design further enhances the displacement range at the cost of a slightly increased current consumption at the onset of the stroke. To analyze the influence of the number of air gaps on the plunger motion the total cross-sectional area of the magnetic core is kept constant while the number of air gaps is varied. Magnetic and mechanical material properties are measured for an accurate simulation of the system behavior. Experimental results confirm the theoretical predictions.},

	abstract = {Tendons are a widely used actuation strategy for continuum robots that enable forces and moments to be transmitted along the robot from base-mounted actuators. Most prior robots have used tendons routed in straight paths along the robot. However, routing tendons through general curved paths within the robot offers potential advantages in reshaping the workspace and enabling a single section of the robot to achieve a wider variety of desired shapes. In this paper, we provide a new model for the statics and dynamics of robots with general tendon routing paths that is derived by coupling the classical Cosserat-rod and Cosserat-string models. This model also accounts for general external loading conditions and includes traditional axially routed tendons as a special case. The advantage of the usage of this coupled model for straight-tendon robots is that it accounts for the distributed wrenches that tendons apply along the robot. We show that these are necessary to consider when the robot is subjected to out-of-plane external loads. Our experimental results demonstrate that the coupled model matches experimental tip positions with an error of 1.7\% of the robot length, in a set of experiments that include both straight and nonstraight routing cases, with both point and distributed external loads.},

In order to regain the tactile and kinesthetic information that is lost, a computerized force feedback endoscopic surgical grasper (FREG) was developed with computer control and a haptic user interface. The system uses standard unmodified grasper shafts and tips. The FREG can control grasping forces either by surgeon teleoperation control, or under software control. The FREG performance was evaluated using an automated palpation function (programmed series of compressions) in which the grasper measures mechanical properties of the grasped materials. The material parameters obtained from measurements showed the ability of the FREG to discriminate between different types of normal soft tissues (small bowel, lung, spleen, liver, colon, and stomach) and different kinds of artificial soft tissue replication materials (latex/silicone) for simulation purposes. In addition, subjective tests of ranking stiffness of silicone materials using the FREG teleoperation mode showed significant improvement in the performance compared to the standard endoscopic grasper. Moreover, the FREG performance was closer to the performance of the human hand than the standard endoscopic grasper. The FREG as a tool incorporating the force feedback teleoperation technology may provide the basis for application in telesurgery, clinical endoscopic surgery, surgical training, and research.},

To provide trainees with performance feedback about tissue-handling skills, it is essential to define objective criteria for judging the safety of applied forces. To be of clinical relevance, these criteria should relate the applied forces to the risk of tissue damage. This experimental study was conducted to determine which tractive forces during suturing cause tissue damage in different types of porcine tissues. Methods Tractive forces were applied on eight different tissue types (fascia, aorta, vena cava, peritoneum, small and large bowel, uterus, and fallopian tube) of 10 different pigs by placing increasingly higher loads on sutures in the tissue. We determined the load at what tissue damage occurred through visual inspection of the tissue. For each tissue sample, three consecutive measurements were performed. Results The average maximum acceptable force varied between 11.43 N for fascia to 1.25 N for fallopian tube. The difference in allowable force between these two structures is almost tenfold. Small bowel can be handled with a tractive force almost 1.5-fold higher than large bowel. Conclusions Each tissue type was found to have its own individual range of acceptable maximum forces before visual tissue damage occurs. With the results presented in this study, it is possible to provide clinically relevant and validated feedback to trainees about their tissue-handling skills.},

	abstract = {A pneumatic muscle (PM) system was studied to determine whether a three-element model could describe its dynamics. As far as the authors are aware, this model has not been used to describe the dynamics of PM. A new phenomenological model consists of a contractile (force-generating) element, spring element, and damping element in parallel. The PM system was investigated using an apparatus that allowed precise and accurate actuation pressure (P) control by a linear servovalve. Length change of the PM was measured by a linear potentiometer. Spring and damping element functions of P were determined by a static perturbation method at several constant P values. These results indicate that at constant P, PM behaves as a spring and damper in parallel. The contractile element function of P was determined by the response to a step input in P, using values of spring and damping elements from the perturbation study. The study showed that the resulting coefficient functions of the three-element model describe the dynamic response to the step input of P accurately, indicating that the static perturbation results can be applied to the dynamic case. This model is further validated by accurately predicting the contraction response to a triangular P waveform. All three elements have pressure-dependent coefficients for pressure P in the range 207 ? P? 621 kPa (30? P? 90 psi). Studies with a step decrease in P (relaxation of the PM) indicate that the damping element coefficient is smaller during relaxation than contraction.{\textbackslash}copyright 2003 Biomedical Engineering Society.},

	abstract = {Long-term human space exploration will require contingencies for emergency medical procedures including some capability to perform surgery. The ability to perform minimally invasive surgery (MIS) would be an important capability. The use of small incisions reduces surgical risk, but also eliminates the ability of the surgeon to view and touch the surgical environment directly. Robotic surgery, or telerobotic surgery, may provide emergency surgical care in remote or harsh environments such as space flight, or extremely forward environments such as battlefields. However, because current surgical robots are large and require extensive support personnel, their implementation has remained limited in forward environments, and they would be difficult, or impossible, to use in space flight or on battlefields. This paper presents experimental analysis of miniature fixed-base and mobile in vivo robots to support MIS surgery in remote and harsh environments. The objective is to develop wireless imaging and task-assisting robots that can be placed inside the abdominal cavity during surgery. Such robots will provide surgical task assistance and enable an on-site or remote surgeon to view the surgical environment from multiple angles. This approach is applicable to long-duration space flight, battlefield situations, and for traditional medical centers and other remote surgical locations.},

Results\&nbsp;\&nbsp;The majority of experience obtained to date has been in animal models. The few human cases and clinical trials that have been performed show excellent promising outcomes with minimal morbidity. Discussion\&nbsp;\&nbsp;The merger of interventional endoscopy and minimally invasive surgery is a natural progression as we continually push the envelope of minimally invasive surgery. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, biliary stents and endoscopic ultrasonography have forever changed treatment algorithms in HPB surgery. Advancement of minimally invasive surgery to include the liver resections, pancreatic resections and pseudocyst management has improved morbidity and become the standard of care in many cases. Continued development of natural orifice techniques may further alter the approaches to the biliary tract, liver and pancreas.},

	abstract = {Electrostatic comb microactuators have had a fundamental limitation in that the allowable travel range is limited to one-third of the total gap between comb fingers. Travel beyond this allowable range results in "pull-in" instability, independent of mechanical design parameters such as stiffness and mass. This brief focuses on the development of an active control system that stabilizes the actuator and allows travel almost over the entire available gap between comb fingers. The challenges to be addressed include the nonlinear dynamics of the actuator and system parameters that vary with each fabricated device. A nonlinear model inversion technique is used to address the nonlinear dynamics of the system. An adaptive controller is developed to provide improved position tracking in the presence of fabrication imperfections. The developed control system is then implemented on a special microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) electrostatic microactuator fabricated using deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers. The use of DRIE allows the fabrication of a high aspect ratio device that can produce large electrostatic forces with low actuation voltages. Experimental results presented in the brief show that the resulting system is capable of traveling 4.0 \&mu;m over a 4.5 \&mu;m full range without "pull in." Good tracking performance is obtained over a wide frequency band. Potential applications of the actuator are in the manipulation of subcellular structures within biological cells, microassembly of hybrid MEMS devices, and manipulation of large molecules such as DNA or proteins.},

	abstract = {Background The concept of single-access procedures has gained greater attention from general surgeons during the past 5Â years. Despite this wide momentum, these procedures pose several changes for the surgeon, such as impaired eye-hand coordination and restricted manipulation. In this context, robotic-assisted surgery represents a promising technology to enhance the dexterity of laparoscopic surgeons. Methods A novel teleoperated robotic system for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) called SPRINT (Single-Port lapaRoscopy bImaNual roboT) has been developed. SPRINT is a master-slave robotic platform designed for bimanual interventions through a single-access port. The system is basically composed by two main arms having a maximum diameter of 18Â mm and a stereoscopic-camera (Karl-Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). The arms may be inserted into a cylindrical introducer that has a maximum diameter of 30Â mm. The surgeon console is composed of two master manipulators, a foot-switch, and a 3D full-HD display. Results In an animal study, a small-bowel enteroenterostomy and the ligation of a mesenteric vessel bundle have been performed. As preliminary experience, the system has been placed within the peritoneal cavity through an incision of approximately 10Â cm: the robot has been suspended in an open fashion, due to some mechanical constraints of the current prototype. The procedures have been performed in an authorized laboratory on a female pig of approximately 50 Kg. Conclusions Two typical surgical maneuvers have been performed successfully with the SPRINT surgical platform: an intestinal anastomosis and a vessel ligation. Moreover, the speed, precision, and force with which the SPRINT robot executed the commands by the surgeon controlling the master console have been subjectively described as adequate to the tasks. Based on this preliminary demonstration, bimanual robot solutions, such as the SPRINT robot, may offer more dexterity and precision to single-port techniques in the next future.},

In the first six cases laparoscopy was performed first followed by culdoscopy; in the last five cases the order was reversed. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: The number of endometriotic implants or adhesions was counted for both operative techniques. The flexible 2.2-mm culdoscope provided a view of the pelvis similar to the laparoscope. Correlation between the procedures was 100\%. The flexible scope achieved better visualization than the standard rigid posterior cul-de-sac culdoscope. CONCLUSION: Flexible culdoscopy is a excellent procedure for diagnostic endoscopy.

The data were measured and modeled in three parts: 1) capsule stiffness, a nonlinear spring model; 2) friction, a modified Karnopp model; and 3) cutting, a constant for a given tissue. In addition, we characterized the effects of needle diameter and tip type on insertion force using a silicone rubber phantom. In comparison to triangular and diamond tips, a bevel tip causes more needle bending and is more easily affected by tissue density variations.

	abstract = {The application of a robot to rehabilitation has become a matter of great concern. This paper deals with functional recovery therapy, one important aspect of physical rehabilitation. Single-joint therapy machines have already been achieved. However, for more efficient therapy, multjoint robots are necessary to achieve more realistic motion patterns. This kind of robot must have a high level of safety for humans. A pneumatic actuator may be available for such a robot, because of the compliance of compressed air. A pneumatic rubber artificial muscle manipulator has been applied to construct a therapy robot with two degrees of freedom (DOF). Also, an impedance control strategy is employed to realize various motion modes for the physical therapy modes. Further, for efficient rehabilitation, it is desirable to comprehend the physical condition of the patient. Thus, the mechanical impedance of the human arm is used as an objective evaluation of recovery, and an estimation method is proposed. Experiments show the suitability of the proposed rehabilitation robot system},

Cholecystectomy, Nissen fundoplication and Heller myotomy are among the most frequently performed operations. The ZEUS (Computer Motion, Goleta, CA) and the da Vinci (Intuitive Surgical, Mountain View, CA) surgical systems are today the most advanced robotic systems used in gastrointestinal surgery. Most studies reported that robotic gastrointestinal surgery is feasible and safe, provides improved dexterity, better visualization, reduced fatigue and high levels of precision when compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery. Its main drawbacks are the absence of force feedback and extremely high costs. At this moment there are no reports to clearly demonstrate the superiority of robotics over conventional laparoscopic surgery.

The pivot point constraint in MIS makes the spherical manipulator a natural candidate. An experimental evaluation process helped to more clearly understand the application and limitations of the spherical mechanism as an MIS robot manipulator. The best configuration consists of two serial manipulators in order to avoid collision problems. A complete kinematic analysis and optimization incorporating the requirements for MIS was performed to find the optimal link lengths of the manipulator. The results show that for the serial spherical 2-link manipulator used to guide the surgical tool, the optimal link lengths (angles) are (60Â°, 50Â°).

Unfortunately, while there have been strides made in advancements of upper arm and leg prosthetics, the state of the art in prosthetic hands is lagging far behind. Options are generally limited to claw like devices that provide limited gripping capacity. The overall objective of this paper is to demonstrate a path towards a low-cost prosthetic hand with multiple articulated fingers and a thumb that rivals the human hand in terms of weight, size, dexterity, range of motion, force carrying capacity and speed. We begin with a description of the functional requirements for a human hand. When comparing requirements with actuation technologies, the fluid power approach has the potential to realize a prosthetic hand that rivals a human hand in size, strength and dexterity. We introduce a new actuation technology, mesofluidics, that focuses on miniaturization of fluid power to the meso-scale (mm to cm). As a novel demonstration of the potential for this technology, we describe a proof-of-principle mesofluidic finger that has intrinsic actuation and control (actuators and control valves within the volume of the finger). This finger weighs 63 grams, is sized to the 50th percentile male finger, has a total of 25 mechanical parts and is capable of providing 10 kg (22 lbs) of pinch force.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Two methods, diesel particulate filter (DPF) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, for controlling diesel emissions have become widely used, either independently or together, for meeting increasingly stringent emissions regulations worldwide. Each of these systems is designed for the reduction of primary pollutant emissions including particulate matter (PM) for DPF and nitrogen oxides (NOx) for SCR. However, there have been growing concerns regarding the secondary reactions that these aftertreatment systems may promote, involving unregulated species emissions. This study was performed to gain an understanding of the effects that these aftertreatment systems may have on the emission levels of a wide spectrum of chemical species found in diesel engine exhaust. Samples were extracted using a source dilution sampling system designed to collect exhaust samples representative of real-world emissions. Testing was conducted on a heavy-duty diesel engine with no aftertreatment devices to establish a baseline measurement and also on the same engine equipped first with a DPF system and then a SCR system. Each of the samples was analyzed for a wide variety of chemical species, including elemental and organic carbon, metals, ions, n-alkanes, aldehydes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in addition to the primary pollutants, due to the potential risks they pose to the environment and public health. The results show that the DPF and SCR systems were capable of substantially reducing PM and NOx emissions, respectively. Further, each of the systems significantly reduced the emission levels of the unregulated chemical species, while the notable formation of new chemical species was not observed. It is expected that a combination of the two systems in some future engine applications would reduce both primary and secondary emissions significantly.},

Additionally, the majority of current worldwide regulatory methods for measuring engine particulate emissions are gravimetrically based. As modern engines considerably reduce particulate mass emissions, these methods become less stable and begin to display higher levels of measurement uncertainty. In this study, a characterization of mass emissions from three heavy-duty diesel engines, with a range of particulate emission levels, was made in order to gain a better understanding of the variability and uncertainty associated with common mass measurement methods, as well as how well these methods compare with each other. Two gravimetric mass measurement methods and a reconstructed mass method were analyzed as part of the present study. The results have shown that each of the mass measurement methods analyzed compare well at higher emission levels, but show significant disparity at the ultra-low emission levels commonly seen from modern diesel engines. Additionally, at ultra-low emissions, the uncertainty in the measurement becomes large, thus reducing confidence in the accuracy of the measurement. Based upon these findings, it would be difficult to justify a comparison between any two gravimetric measurement methods and it may be more appropriate to perform a reconstruction of the particulate mass due to a lower susceptibility to measurement error.},

Thus, with many sections, the arm can be bent into complex shapes to allow redundant positioning of the end effector payload. The kinematics of the entire arm are determined from the segment kinematics. This paper derives and numerically solves the nonlinear kinematics for a single segment of a continuous backbone robot. Optimal spacing of the cable supports maximizes displacement, load capacity, and simplicity of the robot kinematics. An experimental system verifies the theoretically predicted performance.},

Miniature endolumenal robots can mitigate these constraints by providing a stable platform for visualization and dexterous manipulation. This video demonstrates the feasibility of using an endolumenal miniature robot to improve vision and to apply off-axis forces for task assistance in NOTES procedures. MethodsÂÂ ÂÂ A two-armed miniature in vivo robot has been developed for NOTES. The robot is remotely controlled, has on-board cameras for guidance, and grasper and cautery end effectors for manipulation. Two basic configurations of the robot allow for flexibility during insertion and rigidity for visualization and tissue manipulation. Embedded magnets in the body of the robot and in an exterior surgical console are used for attaching the robot to the interior abdominal wall.

Gaining access to the peritoneal cavity through small incisions prompted the first significant shift in general surgery. The complete elimination of external incisions through natural orifice access is potentially the next step in reducing patient trauma. While minimally invasive techniques offer significant patient advantages, the procedures are surgically challenging. Robotic surgical systems are being developed that address the visualization and manipulation limitations, but many of these systems remain constrained by the entry incisions. Alternatively, miniature in vivo robots are being developed that are completely inserted into the peritoneal cavity for laparoscopic and natural orifice procedures. These robots can provide vision and task assistance without the constraints of the entry incision, and can reduce the number of incisions required for laparoscopic procedures. In this study, a series of minimally invasive animal-model surgeries were performed using multiple miniature in vivo robots in cooperation with existing laparoscopy and endoscopy tools as well as the da Vinci Surgical System. These procedures demonstrate that miniature in vivo robots can address the visualization constraints of minimally invasive surgery by providing video feedback and task assistance from arbitrary orientations within the peritoneal cavity.},

	abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) reduces patient trauma and shortens recovery time, but also limits the dexterity of the surgeon because degrees of freedom are lost due to the fulcrum effect of the entry incisions. Visual feedback is also limited by the laparoscope, which typically provides two-dimensional feedback and is constrained by the entry incision. Developments within surgical robotics aim to mitigate these constraints. However, these developments have primarily included large external machines that augment vision and improve dexterity, but are still fundamentally constrained by the use of long tools through small incisions. An alternative concept is the use of miniature in vivo surgical robots that can be placed entirely into the peritoneal cavity through either an abdominal incision, or, after insertion into the stomach through the esophagus, can enter through a gastrotomy. This paper reviews the development of fixed-base camera robots for providing auxiliary views of the surgical field and of mobile robots with a movable platform for vision and task assistance in laparoscopic procedures.

	abstract = {Background Interest in single-incision laparoscopic techniques continues to grow. A learning curve certainly exists, and although the techniques have improved, technical considerations including external clashes, poor visualization of critical structures, and surgeon fatigue remain. Applications of robotics to these newer techniques are evolving. The da Vinci Single-Site robotic surgery platform is a new semi-rigid robotic operative system designed to work with the Intuitive Surgical da Vinci Si operative system. The authors present the first human experience with this new device used to perform single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This study aimed to present the first human experience performing cholecystectomy with a novel robotic single-port platform. Methods After Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board approval, patients with symptomatic biliary disease fitting standard criteria for cholecystectomy were enrolled in the study. A total of 13 consecutive single-port, robotic cholecystectomy operations were performed. Patient demographics and operative results were evaluated. Results All 13 operations were completed successfully with the Single-Site platform. A critical view of safety as determined by the operative surgeon was obtained in all cases. One patient required placement of an additional extra-umbilical trocar for appropriate visualization secondary to gallbladder necrosis, and this incision also was used for eventual drain placement. For two patients, an intraoperative choloangiogram was performed. The mean operative time was 107Â Â±Â 54Â min, and the mean docking time was 15Â Â±Â 9Â min. Discharge for 11 patients was within 24Â h. No significant complications occurred. Conclusion Cholecystectomy using the da Vinci Single-Site system is feasible. Availability of this new semi-rigid, robotic surgery platform may increase access to the potential advantages of single-site surgery. Additional advantages of single-site surgery may be elucidated with further studies.},

	abstract = {The McKibben artificial muscle is a pneumatic actuator whose properties include a very high force to weight ratio. This characteristic makes it very attractive for a wide range of applications such as mobile robots and prosthetic appliances for the disabled. Typical applications often require a significant number of repeated contractions and extensions or cycles of the actuator. This repeated action leads to fatigue and failure of the actuator, yielding a life span that is often shorter than its more common robotic counterparts such as electric motors or pneumatic cylinders. In this paper, we develop a model that predicts the maximum number of life cycles of the actuator based on available uniaxial tensile properties of the actuator's inner bladder.

Previous work by our group and others suggests that haptic feedback might significantly enhance the execution of surgical tasks requiring fine suture manipulation, specifically those encountered in cardiothoracic surgery. We studied the effects of substituting direct haptic feedback with visual and auditory cues to provide the operating surgeon with a representation of the forces he or she is applying with robotic telemanipulators.MethodsUsing the robotic da Vinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif), we compared applied forces during a standardized surgical knot-tying task under 4 different sensory-substitution scenarios: no feedback, auditory feedback, visual feedback, and combined auditory-visual feedback.ResultsThe forces applied with these sensory-substitution modes more closely approximate suture tensions achieved under ideal haptic conditions (ie, hand ties) than forces applied without such sensory feedback. The consistency of applied forces during robot-assisted suture tying aided by visual feedback or combined auditory-visual feedback sensory substitution is superior to that achieved with hand ties. Robot-assisted ties aided with auditory feedback revealed levels of consistency that were generally equivalent or superior to those attained with hand ties. Visual feedback and auditory feedback improve the consistency of robotically applied forces.ConclusionsSensory substitution, in the form of visual feedback, auditory feedback, or both, confers quantifiable advantages in applied force accuracy and consistency during the performance of a simple surgical task.},

	abstract = {Objectives To present our initial experience with single-port laparoscopic urologic surgery using the Uni-X Single Port Access Laparoscopic System, a single port, multichannel cannula, with specially designed curved laparoscopic instrumentation. Methods We performed single-port laparoscopic surgery in 10 patients, including renal cryotherapy in 4, wedge kidney biopsy in 1, radical nephrectomy in 1, and abdominal sacrocolpopexy in 4. For the transperitoneal approach, the multichannel port was inserted transumbilically, and for retroperitoneoscopy, the port was inserted at the tip of the 12th rib. Data were collected prospectively into our institutional review board-approved data registry. Results Since September 25, 2007, a total of 10 patients have undergone single-port laparoscopic surgery for various upper abdominal and pelvic pathologic findings. All cases were completed successfully, without conversion to a standard laparoscopic approach. The total operative time for the various kidney procedures was 2.5 hours (range 2 to 3.2) and was 2.5 hours (range 2 to 3) for sacrocolpopexy. The mean blood loss was 100 mL for the renal procedures and 90 mL for sacrocolpopexy. The hospital stay was 2.8 days (range 1 to 8) for the kidney procedures and 2 days for sacrocolpopexy. One complication occurred in a patient with baseline congestive heart failure who underwent cryoablation and required oxygen mask ventilation postoperatively that delayed her hospital discharge for 1 week. The same patient, who was anemic preoperatively, was transfused with 3 U of packed red blood cells, although the postoperative computed tomography scan revealed a small perinephric hematoma. Conclusions Single-port laparoscopic renal cryotherapy, wedge kidney biopsy, radical nephrectomy, and abdominal sacrocolpopexy are safe and feasible. Additional experience and continued investigation are warranted.},

The peritoneal cavity was examined, and a liver biopsy specimen was obtained. The gastric wall incision was closed with clips. OBSERVATIONS: Twelve acute and 5 survival experiments were performed. Both techniques of gastric wall incision were without complication. The acute experiments demonstrated the technical feasibility of the approach. In the survival experiments, all pigs recovered and gained weight.

These 50-\&mu;m-tall vertical mirrors were fabricated by the deep-etch shallow-diffusion process. The released Si mirrors have smooth sidewalls with 5-nm surface roughness. An electrostatic comb drive applied to actuate the mirrors which were supported by folded or serpentine beams. For 800-\&mu;m-long, 3-\&mu;m-wide, and 50-\&mu;m-thick folded suspension beams, a lateral mirror movement of 34 \&mu;m was achieved by a driving voltage of 30 V. Resonant frequency of 987 Hz was obtained for similar devices at atmospheric pressure. There are tradeoffs between mirror displacement and resonant frequency. The mirror displacement increases with beam length (BL) and decreases with beam width (BW). However, the resonant frequency increases with BW, but decreases with BL, which is in agreement with the theoretical calculations. These vertical Si micromirrors were coated with Au to increase the reflectivity. Magnetron sputtering of Au at low pressure was applied to achieve uniform and smooth sidewall coverage. Optical measurement on 50-\&mu;m-tall Au-coated Si mirrors showed a reflectivity of 85\% (-0.71 dB). Dynamic response of the Si micromirror switches was measured, and the switching function was successfully demonstrated at a frequency up to 1.2 KHz},

	abstract = {Background: The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of the da Vinci robotic system using both the three-dimensional view (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) view options with traditional manually assisted laparoscopic techniques in performing standardized exercises. Methods: To evaluate surgical efficiency in the use of robotically assisted and manual laparoscopic surgery for standardized exercises six, last-year medical students without any surgical experience were selected. The exercises consisted of placing rings over receptacles, grasping a free hanging suture and cutting three pieces of it, running a suture, and performing a surgical knot. Each student performed the exercise twice. The median times needed for completion of the exercises and the median number of errors in performing the tasks were noted. Results: The unexperienced students performed the standardized tasks significantly quicker and with fewer errors when assisted by the da Vinci robot in the 3D optical display mode, as compared with traditional manually assisted laparoscopic surgery. Even when the 2D mode was selected, a significant advantage favoring the da Vinci robotic system was seen both in time and efficacy for most exercises. When the 3D and 2D modes were compared, time differences in favor of the 3D mode remained, but a significant difference in efficacy favoring the 3D mode was seen only in one exercise (exercise 2: suture cutting). Conclusions: The da Vinci robotic system permits standardized minimal invasive surgical exercises to be performed quicker and more efficiently than traditional minimally invasive techniques. Therefore, with the aid of this robotic system, difficult laparoscopic interventions may become easier to perform, and indications for minimal invasive surgery may be expanded.},

How a defined stiffness ratio influences the critical voltage is discussed based on numerical calculation. The effect of lateral and angular offsets on the critical voltage is analyzed. Numerical calculation shows that when there exists a lateral offset of 10, 20 or 50\% of the one side gap, the critical voltage drops 25, 40 or 72\%, respectively.

This capability opens up a new territory for flow control research. On the other hand, surface effects dominate the fluid flowing through these miniature mechanical devices because of the large surface-to-volume ratio in micron-scale configurations. We need to reexamine the surface forces in the momentum equation. Owing to their smallness, gas flows experience large Knudsen numbers, and therefore boundary conditions need to be modified.

This pioneering procedure was based on the animal experiments of Georg Kelling (1866-1945), a German physician from Dresden, who performed the first laparoscopic intervention in 1901 using a Nitz cystoscope in a dog. In 1910, Jacobaeus published his initial experiences with laparoscopic surgery in the Münchner Medizinischen Wochenschrift under the title "The Possibilities for Performing Cystoscopy in Examinations of Serous Cavities." He used this technique for diagnostic purposes in undefined abdominal complaints and functional impairment. Jacobaeus was the first who pointed out the possibility of injuring organs, especially the intestines, by inserting the trocar. In 1910, Jacobaeus recognized the immense diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities of laparoscopic surgery, as well as its difficulties and limits. He also was the first to realize the need for initial endoscopic training in animals and corpses. He promoted the development of special laparoscopic instruments to optimize and simplify the procedure.},

Specifically, we seek to examine some of the kinematic properties of â€ continuumâ€ hyper-redundant robots. Unlike the case with rigid-link robots, there is no commonly accepted formula for describing continuum robot kinematics. Although these manipulators are continuously flexible, they are actuated with a finite number of actuators. We discuss two possible options for mapping desired infinite-dimensional robot shapes to the finite-dimensional actuator space, using â€ naturalâ€ and â€ waveletâ€ decompositions.

	abstract = {Serpentine robots, also sometimes called "snake robots," are slender, multisegmented vehicles designed to provide greater mobility than conventional wheeled or tracked robots. Serpentine robots are typically comprised of three or more rigid segments connected by two or three degrees of freedom joints. The segments typically have powered wheels, tracks, or legs to propel the vehicle forward; the joints may be powered or unpowered. We have developed a joint actuator system that is highly optimized for use in serpentine robots. This article first presents an analysis of the particular requirements for joint actuators in serpentine robots. We then compare existing actuators against those requirements and show that pneumatic bellows are ideally suited for this application. Following this analysis, this paper introduces our fully functional, pneumatically operated actuation system that is efficiently integrated in the space occupied by a joint. This system, which we call an "integrated joint actuator," also allows simultaneous proportional control of position and stiffness of the joint. The key advantages of our design over other joint actuation methods are its great strength combined with controllable compliance and minimal space requirements.},

A nonlinear model of the actuator relates the resonant frequency and the maximum stable deflection to the actuator dimensions. A suite of experiments that were carried out on deep reactive ion etched (DRIE), single-crystal silicon, comb-drive actuators confirm the validity of the model. Four actuator design improvements were implemented. First, a folded-flexure suspension consisting of two folded beams rather than four and a U-shaped shuttle allowed the actuator area to be cut in half without degrading its performance. Second, the comb teeth were designed with linearly increasing lengths to reduce side instability by a factor of two. Third, the folded-flexure suspensions were fabricated in an initially bent configuration, improving the suspension stiffness ratio and reducing side instability by an additional factor of 30. Finally, additional actuation range was achieved using a launch and capture actuation scheme in which the actuator was allowed to swing backward after full forward deflection; the shuttle was captured and held using the backs of the comb banks as high-force, parallel-plate actuators.},

The present study instead adopted a systems approach to evaluate the net effect of the corresponding technologies for model-year 2004 and 2007 engines. The 2004 engine was equipped with an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system, while the 2007 engine had an EGR system, a crankcase emissions coalescer, and a diesel particulate filter. The test engines were operated under the transient federal test procedure and samples were collected with a source dilution sampling system designed to stimulate atmospheric cooling and dilution conditions. The samples were analyzed for elemental carbon, organic carbon, and C 1 , C 2 , and C 10 through C 33 particle-phase and semi-volatile organic compounds. Of the more than 150 organic species analyzed, the largest portion of the emissions from the 2004 engine consisted of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and naphthalene and its derivatives, which were significantly reduced by the 2007 engine and emissions technology. The systems approach in this study simulates the operation of real-world diesel engines, and may provide insight into the future development of integrated engine technology. The results supply updated information for assessing the impact of diesel engine emissions on the chemical processes, radiative properties, and toxic components of the atmosphere.},

Such comparisons provide new tests of Rivlin's theory and, at least in principle, critical tests of proposed strain energy functions for rubber.

	abstract = {During the last 10 years, minimally invasive surgery has influenced the techniques used in every specialty of surgical medicine. This development has not only led to the replacement of conventional procedures with minimally invasive ones, but has also stimulated surgeons to reevaluate conventional approaches with regard to perioperative parameters such as pain medication. However, two major drawbacks have emerged with the introduction of this new technique: firstly, the prolonged learning curve for most surgeons, in comparison with the learning process in open surgery; and secondly, increased costs due to investment in the equipment required and the use of disposable instruments, as well as longer operating times. In the various health-care systems around the world, these increased costs are not always compensated for by shorter hospital stays. This review focuses on major areas of indication for minimally invasive surgery in the gastrointestinal tract. These include functional disorders of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, obesity surgery, minimally invasive techniques in gastric and hepatobiliary surgery and in other solid organs, and laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The shortening of the hospitalization period has led to increasing use of outpatient laparoscopic surgery, and many centers specializing in day-care surgery are using these techniques. The frontiers are being pushed even further, as the size of the instruments is reduced to achieve better cosmetic results. Clinical research has also focused on the topic of expanding the indications for minimally invasive approaches in the elderly and in high-risk patients, to take advantage of the shorter hospital stays and reduced surgical trauma that are possible. A considerable amount of basic research has been carried out on the stress response during and after minimally invasive procedures, and an improved immune response with the minimally invasive approach has been observed, leading to better results after extensive oncological procedures. Robotic surgery and telesurgery involve new computer-aided methods that allow greater precision in surgical technique, as well as offering an opportunity to supply surgical skill and expertise remotely, over long distances. Minimally invasive surgical techniques are thus now fully established in routine use, and the indications are continuing to expand.},

	abstract = {While there are many benefits to minimally invasive surgery (MIS), force feedback or touch sensation is limited in the currently available MIS tools, such as surgical robots, creating the potential for excessive force application during surgery and unintended tissue injury. The goal of this work was to develop a methodology with which to identify stress magnitudes and durations that can be safely applied with a MIS grasper to di ferent tissues, potentially improving MIS device design and reducing potentially adverse clinically relevant consequences. Using the porcine model, stresses typically applied in MIS were applied to liver, ureter and small bowel using a motorized endoscopic grasper. Acute indicators of tissue damage including cellular death and infiltration of inflammatory cells were measured using histological and image analysis techniques. Finite element analysis was used to identify approximate stress distributions experienced by the tissues. Parameters used in these finite element models specifically reflected the properties of liver, which served as an initial proxy for all tissues, as stress distributions rather than absolute values were desired. Local regions predicted to have uniform stress by the computational models were mapped to and analyzed in the tissue samples for acute damage. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc analyses were used to detect stress magnitudes and durations that caused significantly increased tissue damage with the goal to ultimately identify safe stress `thresholds' during grasping of the studied tissues. Preliminary data suggests a graded non-linear response between applied stress magnitude and apoptosis in liver and small bowel as well as neutrophil infiltration in the small bowel. The ureter appeared to be more resistant to injury at the tested stress levels. By identifying stress magnitudes and durations within the range of grasping loads applied in MIS, it may be possible for researchers to create a `smart' surgical robot that can guide a surgeon to manipulate tissues with minimal resulting damage. In addition, surgical simulator design can be improved to reflect more realistic tissue responses and evaluate trainees' tissue handling skills.},

	abstract = {Pneumatic technology has been successfully applied for over two millennia. Even today, pneumatic cylinder based technology forms the keystone of many manufacturing processes where there is a need for simple, high-speed, low-cost, reliable motion. But when the system requires accurate control of position, velocity or acceleration profiles, these actuators form a far from satisfactory solution. Braided pneumatic muscle actuators (pMAs) form an interesting development of the pneumatic principle offering even higher power/weight performance, operation in a wide range of environments and accurate control of position, motion and force. This technology provides an interesting and potentially very successful alternative actuation source for robots as well as other applications. However, there are difficulties with this approach due to the following. (i) Modeling errors. Models of the force response are still nonoptimal and for good results these models are highly complex, which makes accurate design difficult. (ii) Low bandwidth–the bandwidth of the actuator–link assemblies are often considered to be too low for practical success in many applications, particularly robotics. In this paper we address these limitations and show how the performance in each area can be enhanced with overall improvements in the response and utility of the braided pMAs. 10.1177/0278364903022003006},

However, the dynamic response (bandwidth) has been inferior to electric systems, with a secondary concern over system stiffness. In this paper, the bandwidth limit is addressed from two perspectives; air flow effects and the physical structure of the actuator. It is shown that by reducing the dead volume within the muscle structure (by the addition of a variety of filler materials) the bandwidth can be increased by up to 400\%, with similar increases in system stiffness. At the same time the air volume used to power the actuator can be reduced by up to 80-90\%. The methods of achieving these improvements are fully assessed. Also, by ensuring effective air flow rates, it is shown that bandwidth limits can be increased by several 100\% and potentially increases of 1000s\% are possible},

This paper seeks to explore the nature of the contractile limit and the hysteresis observed by researchers during the actuation cycle. Maximum actuator dilation occurs when adjacent braid strands are forced against one another. Within this work this is analyzed mathematically and it is shown that by halving the number of strands used to create the braided shell the actuator's contractile range can be increased by approximately 7\%. This also results in a simultaneous peak contractile force increases of over 16\%. These results are verified experimentally. Hysteresis due to friction between braid strands during muscle operation is also explored. The paper will show how consideration of the deformation of the strands allows the contact area and therefore friction to be calculated without the need for experimentally obtained data as in previous research.

	abstract = {Hyper-redundant, or 'snake-like', manipulators have a very large number of actuatable degrees of freedom. This paper develops an efficient formulation of approximate hyper-redundant manipulator dynamics. The most efficient methods for representing manipulator dynamics in the literature require serial computations proportional to the number of degrees of freedom. Furthermore, these methods are not fully parallelizable. For hyper-redundant manipulators, which may have tens, hundreds or thousands of actuators, these formulations preclude real time implementation. This paper therefore looks at the mechanics of hyper-redundant manipulators from the point of view of an approximation to an 'infinite degree-or-freedom' (or continuum) problem. The dynamics for this case is developed. The approximate dynamics of actual hyper-redundant manipulators is then reduced to a problem which is O(1) in time, i.e. the algorithm is O(n) is the total number of computations, but these computations can be completely distributed over n parallel processors. This is achieved by 'projecting' the dynamics of the continuum model onto the actual robotic structure. Applications of this method to practical computed torque control schemes for hyper-redundant manipulators is demonstrated with two examples: (i) industrial pick-and-place tasks and (ii) inspection in an environment filled with viscous sludge, such as a hazardous waste dump. The results are compared with a lumped mass model of a particular hyper-redundant manipulator.},

	abstract = {Electrostatic comb-drive actuators have been developed and employed for many applications. However, side stability (side pull-in) limits the actuator stroke constraining its applications. Hence, extending the stable traveling range is an important issue for designing electrostatic comb-drive actuators. This study presents a novel cascade electrostatic comb-drive actuator. Instead of shifting the spring constant of the suspended springs, the proposed actuator extends the stable traveling range using a multi-stage cascade configuration. To demonstrate the performance of the cascade configuration, simulation using the finite element method is utilized to model the proposed cascade actuator. To implement the cascade electrostatic comb-drive actuator, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) 0.35 mm two-polysilicon and four-metal layer (2p4m) CMOS processes and post-CMOS micromachining steps are employed to fabricate the device. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed design extends the stable traveling range to 200\% as compared with that of a comb-drive actuator without this cascade configuration.},

	abstract = {New comb drives using high stiffness ratio springs are designed and modeled to provide capabilities of large static displacement and continuous motion for applications, such as micro XY stage, two dimensional lens scanner, variable optical attenuator, and optical switch, etc. The maximum static displacement of conventional comb drive is constrained by the side sticking effect of comb finger electrodes. Since the side sticking effect will become obvious and exhibit strong impact on actuator behavior in the case that the spring lateral stiffness is decreased when the static displacement is increased, and the rotation moment caused by unbalanced force between electrode fingers resulted from the environment disturbance and/or fabrication deviation will enhance the side pulling phenomena. The aforementioned sticking effect occurs at the static displacement smaller than the analytical results estimated by conventional stability criteria. Thus, a new stability criterion is proposed for providing more accurate predicted maximum static displacement. A new hybrid spring with an n -shaped joint for comb drive is developed and proposed in this paper as well. This new spring is capable of not only enhancing the lateral stiffness against to the lateral mechanical disturbance and shock, but also efficiently eliminating the rotation moment caused by the disturbance over the large displacement range. The design scheme is verified by the simulation results.},

The surface displacement preceding puncture was also measured. These data are relevant to an understanding of surgical technique and are essential to the development of electronic surgical simulators. Methods: Controlled puncture experiments were performed on intact organs harvested from pigs and sheep, as well as on their surface capsules following removal and suspension at zero strain and at three increasing levels of prestrain. The biomechanical data were compared with information obtained from histological studies. Results: The spleen has a higher puncture force than the liver and suffers greater displacement before puncture (p \&lt; 0.05). Prestrain decreases displacement before puncture (p \&lt; 0.05) but has no effect on puncture force. Conclusion: The higher puncture force and displacement of spleen, as compared with liver, is probably due to its higher elastin content.},

	abstract = {Comb drives inherently suffer from electromechanical instability called lateral pull-in, side pull-in or, sometimes, lateral instability. Although fabricated to be perfectly symmetrical, the actuator's comb structure is always unbalanced, causing adjacent finger electrodes to contact each other when voltage-deflection conditions are favorable. Lateral instability decreases the active traveling range of the actuator, and the problem is typically approached by improving the mechanical design of the suspension. In this paper, a novel approach to counteracting the pull-in phenomenon is proposed. It is shown that the pull-in problem can be successfully counteracted by introducing active feedback steering of the lateral motion. In order to do this, however, the actuator must be controllable in the lateral direction, and lateral deflection measurements need to be available. It is shown herein how to accomplish this. The experimentally verified dynamic model of the comb drive is extended with a lateral motion model. The lateral part of the model is verified through experimental results and finite element analysis and is hypothetically extended to accommodate both sensor and actuator functionalities for lateral movement. A set of simulations is performed to illustrate the improved traveling range gained by the controller.},

These limitations can be overcome by taking advantage of fluid power as an enabling technology with its inherent power density and controllability. As a proof-of-concept for this approach, we are pursuing the design of a novel, dexterous robotic surgical tool targeted towards transgastric natural orifice surgery. The design for this hydraulic surgical platform and the corresponding analysis are presented to demonstrate the theoretical system performance in terms of tool positioning and input requirements. The design involves a combination of a novel 3D valve, hydraulic artificial muscles, and multi-segmented flexible manipulator arms that fit in the lumen of an endoscope. A dynamic model of the system is created. Numerical simulations show that a hydraulic endoscopic surgical robot can produce the desired performance without using large external manipulators such as those employed by conventional surgical robots. They also provide insight into the component interactions and input response of the system. Future work will include manufacturing a prototype to validate the concept and the numerical models.},

	abstract = {Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy rapidly became the standard of care for the surgical treatment of cholelithiasis, very few other abdominal or cardiac operations are currently performed using minimally invasive surgical techniques. The inherent limitations of traditional laparoscopic surgery make it difficult to perform these operations. We, and others, have attempted to use robotic technology to (a) provide a stable camera platform, (b) replace two-dimensional with three-dimensional (3-D) imaging, (c) simulate the fluid motions of a surgeon's wrist to overcome the motion limitations of straight laparoscopic instruments, and (d) offer the surgeon a comfortable, ergonomically optimal operating position. In this article, we review the early published clinical experience with surgical robotic and telerobotic systems and assess their current limitations. The voice-controlled AESOP robot replaces the cameraperson and facilitates the performance of solo-surgeon laparoscopic operations. AESOP provides a stable camera platform and avoids motion sickness in the operative team. The telerobotic Zeus and da Vinci surgical systems permit solo surgery by a surgeon from a remote sight. These telerobots hold the camera, replace the surgeon's two hands with robotic instruments, and serve in a masterâÂ€Â“slave relationship for the surgeon. Their robotic instruments simulate the motions of the surgeon's wrist, facilitating dissection. Both telerobots use 3-D imaging to immerse the surgeon in a three-dimensional video operating field. These robots also provide operating positions for the surgeon console that are ergonomically superior to those required by traditional laparoscopy. The technological advances of these telerobots now permit telepresence surgery from remote locations, even locations thousands of miles away. In addition, telepresence permits the telementoring of novice surgeons who are performing new procedures by expert surgeons in remote locations. The studies reviewed here indicate that robotics and telerobotics offer potential solutions to the inherent problems of traditional laparoscopic surgery, as well as new possibilities for telesurgery and telementoring. Nonetheless, these technologies are still in an early stage of development, and each device entails its own set of challenges and limitations for actual use in clinical settings.},

The PPS method provides both position and stiffness control for a robot joint driven by a pneumatic cylinder with four ON-OFF valves. In addition, the proposed control system consumes much less compressed air than comparable strategies. These features make the PPS method highly suitable to application in mobile robots.},

	title = {Design of a {Hydraulic} {Dexterous} {Manipulator} for {Minimally} {Invasive} {Surgery}},
	abstract = {The research described here identifies the limitations of existing robotic surgical platforms, which include the balance between the scale of the robot and its manipulability in terms of range of motion, load capacity, and tool capability, then develops a means of overcoming them by taking advantage of fluid power as an enabling technology with its inherent power density and controllability. The approach described here differs significantly from conventional surgical robots in that the robot is embedded within the surgical device itself, whereas in the conventional system, a general-purpose robot is used to manipulate various surgical tools. This is done in order to demonstrate that fluid power can be used advantageously for the design of embedded surgical robotic systems for minimally invasive surgery.

To enable the design of a fluid powered surgical robot, it was first necessary to identify the design requirements for a robot of this nature as well as the considerations unique to this approach. To this end, a quantification of the necessary load capacity for natural orifice robots was conducted. Further, through a review of the literature in the fields of surgery and robotics, considerations of necessary workspace and limitations for the prevention of tissue damage were explored. The results of these analyses are presented.

The technologies that comprise this novel surgical robotic system include a hydraulic control valve, actuation units, and an enabling structure. The intended application of these technologies introduced numerous limitations and challenges to the design process. The most stringent of these limitations was that of overall size, due to the realities of patient anatomy, which prevented the use of commercially available hydraulic components. An assemblage of components to achieve the aforementioned design requirements is described including the design of a novel hydraulic control valve to enable manipulation of three actuators using a single valve sized to fit within the working channel of a surgical endoscope.

The advantage of the described approach is that the device enables greater miniaturization, improves cost effectiveness, and has better ease of mobility. The mobility and the relaxed requirements for operating room cleanliness can be potentially useful for mobile clinics, out-patient clinical settings, and on the battlefield. Being more cost effective and having a small overall size, the robotic assisted surgical devices can be widely deployed, even in rural or other less technology intensive environments. Through careful review of the literature and analytical evaluation of the various proposed concepts, it was possible to arrive at a design that meets the needs of modern surgical interventions while addressing the perceived limitations of existing surgical robotics.

Through the efforts described in this dissertation, much new information was produced and developments resulted. The considerations of hydraulic power for surgical robots were evaluated and are applicable to other surgical tasks where hydraulic power may be used advantageously. A quantification of the load requirements for surgical robots performing abdominal procedures was produced which will provide a guide for other researchers developing surgical robots. These values are difficult to find in the literature and are a valuable resource for the field. An alternative, simplified model for predicting the behavior of continuum beams under load was developed to provide an inverse formulation for computing beam shape and end loads. This is useful as continuum beams are widely used for minimally invasive surgical manipulators as well as in a wide variety of other applications. Finally, a novel valve concept and two possible designs realizing this concept were developed. These valve designs facilitate control over the three actuators in an antagonistic arrangement. Further, the valve designs enable proportional control of the three actuators at a size scale not commercially available. In summary, the design of a novel hydraulic surgical manipulator as a summation of its parts has been performed. This design demonstrates the feasibility of the fluid power approach to embedded minimally invasive surgical robotics. The pursuit of this research has provided many unique challenges and the work presented here has addressed many of them, as well as laid the foundation for future developments in the application of hydraulic power to the growing field of surgical robotics for minimally invasive surgery.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the complete development and analysis of a soft robotic platform that exhibits peristaltic locomotion. The design principle is based on the antagonistic arrangement of circular and longitudinal muscle groups of Oligochaetes. Sequential antagonistic motion is achieved in a flexible braided mesh-tube structure using a nickel titanium (NiTi) coil actuators wrapped in a spiral pattern around the circumference. An enhanced theoretical model of the NiTi coil spring describes the combination of martensite deformation and spring elasticity as a function of geometry. A numerical model of the mesh structures reveals how peristaltic actuation induces robust locomotion and details the deformation by the contraction of circumferential NiTi actuators. Several peristaltic locomotion modes are modeled, tested, and compared on the basis of speed. Utilizing additional NiTi coils placed longitudinally, steering capabilities are incorporated. Proprioceptive potentiometers sense segment contraction, which enables the development of closed-loop controllers. Several appropriate control algorithms are designed and experimentally compared based on locomotion speed and energy consumption. The entire mechanical structure is made of flexible mesh materials and can withstand significant external impact during operation. This approach allows a completely soft robotic platform by employing a flexible control unit and energy sources.},

This field, which is known as biomimetics, offers enormous potential for inspiring new capabilities for exciting future technologies. There are numerous examples of biomimetic successes that involve making simple copies, such as the use of fins for swimming. Others examples involved greater mimicking complexity including the mastery of flying that became possible only after the principles of aerodynamics were better understood. Some commercial implementations of biomimetics, including robotic toys and movie subjects, are increasingly appearing and behaving like living creatures. More substantial benefits of biomimetics include the development of prosthetics that closely mimic real limbs and sensory-enhancing microchips that are interfaced with the brain to assist in hearing, seeing and controlling instruments. A review is given of selected areas that were inspired by nature, and an outlook for potential development in biomimetics is presented.},

Results are presented for 11 patients. The method was used in a pilot study to assess the effects of four valgus knee braces on medial compartment forces. An analysis of variance could not detect un-loading by any brace although there were large variations in force output. These variations may be attributable to shifts in the sensor position.

It is thus desirable to determine and analyze, and possibly foresee, as accurately as possible what radiation exposures crew members involved in EVAs will experience in order to minimize risks and to establish exposure limits that must not to be exceeded. A detailed CAD model of the U.S. Space Shuttle EVA Spacesuit, developed at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC), is used to represent the directional shielding of an astronaut; it has detailed helmet and backpack structures, hard upper torso, and multilayer space suit fabric material. The NASA Computerized Anatomical Male and Female (CAM and CAF) models are used in conjunction with the space suit CAD model for dose evaluation within the human body. The particle environments are taken from the orbit-averaged NASA AP8 and AE8 models at solar cycle maxima and minima. The transport of energetic particles through space suit materials and body tissue is calculated by using the NASA LaRC HZETRN code for hadrons and a recently developed deterministic transport code, ELTRN, for electrons. The doses within the CAM and CAF models are determined from energy deposition at given target points along 968 directional rays convergent on the points and are evaluated for several points on the skin and within the body. Dosimetric quantities include contributions from primary protons, light ions, and electrons, as well as from secondary brehmsstrahlung and target fragments. Directional dose patterns are displayed as rays and on spherical surfaces by the use of a color relative intensity representation.},

This work determined the accuracy of motion between two RBs using an Optotrak optical motion capture system with active infrared LEDs. The stationary noise in the system was quantified by recording the apparent change in position with the RBs stationary and found to be 0.04 degrees and 0.03 mm. Incremental 10 degrees rotations and 10-mm translations were made using a more precise tool than the Optotrak. Increasing camera distance decreased the precision or increased the range of values observed for a set motion and increased the error in rotation or bias between the measured and actual rotation. The relative positions of the RBs with respect to the camera-viewing plane had a minimal effect on the kinematics and, therefore, for a given distance in the volume less than or close to the precalibrated camera distance, any motion was similarly reliable. For a typical operating set-up, a 10 degrees rotation showed a bias of 0.05 degrees and a 95\% repeatability limit of 0.67 degrees. A 10-mm translation showed a bias of 0.03 mm and a 95\% repeatability limit of 0.29 mm. To achieve a high level of accuracy it is important to keep the distance between the cameras and the markers near the distance the cameras are focused to during calibration.},

	abstract = {Modular augmented stems of a constrained condylar knee implant are intended to improve tibial fixation under increased varus/valgus loads, but conflicting studies have not yet indicated the factors determining stem usage and performance. To address this, we combined a paired-tibiae, cadaveric experiment of unstemmed and stemmed tibial components with specimen-specific computational models. We hypothesized that the stem would improve implant stability by decreasing implant motion and compressive strains in the proximal cancellous bone due to load transfer by the stem. The models also would indicate the important factors governing stem performance. Large variations of the displacements arose because of loading and biologic variability indicating the inconclusive effects of a stem. Despite these variations, the models showed that a stem augment consistently decreased the strains (30\%-50\%) in the bone beneath the tray. In tibiae of sufficient stiffness, the supporting cancellous bone did not approach yield, suggesting that a stem augment may not always be necessary. On the other hand, tibial specimens with reduced bone quality and lower stiffness benefited from a stem augment that transferred load to the distal cortical bone. Therefore, patient selection and proper sizing of the implant were identified as important factors in the analyses.},

	abstract = {There is a high incidence of low back pain (LBP) associated with occupations requiring sustained and/or repetitive lumbar flexion (SLF and RLF, respectively), which cause creep of the viscoelastic tissues. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of creep on lumbar biomechanics and facet joint capsule (FJC) strain. Specimens were flexed for 10 cycles, to a maximum 10 Nm moment at L5-S1, before, immediately after, and 20 min after a 20-min sustained flexion at the same moment magnitude. The creep rates of SLF and RLF were also measured during each phase and compared to the creep rate predicted by the moment relaxation rate function of the lumbar spine. Both SLF and RLF resulted in significantly increased intervertebral motion, as well as significantly increased FJC strains at the L3-4 to L5-S1 joint levels. These parameters remained increased after the 20-min recovery. Creep during SLF occurred significantly faster than creep during RLF. The moment relaxation rate function was able to accurately predict the creep rate of the lumbar spine at the single moment tested. The data suggest that SLF and RLF result in immediate and residual laxity of the joint and stretch of the FJC, which could increase the potential for LBP.},

Three hundred and fifty-five bone specimens from the metacarpi of 10 horses were machined into right cylinders aligned with the long axis of the bone. A computed tomographic scan of the specimens, along with a Cann-Genant K2HPO4 calibration standard, was obtained. The specimens then were compressed to failure, and the elastic modulus, yield stress, yield strain, strain energy density at yield, ultimate stress, ultimate strain, and strain energy density at ultimate failure were calculated. The specimens were dried and ashed. Quantitative computed tomography-derived K2HPO4 equivalent density proved to be an excellent estimator (r2 {\textgreater} 0.9) of elastic modulus, yield stress, ultimate stress, wet density, dry density, and ash density; a moderately good estimator (0.4 {\textless} r2 {\textless} 0.9) of strain energy density at yield and at ultimate failure; and a poor estimator (r2 {\textless} 0.2) of yield strain and ultimate strain.

It existed in early Native American populations several thousand years ago but might not have appeared in Europe until the 17th century. Early theories on the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis focused on autoantibodies and immune complexes. T-cell-mediated antigen-specific responses, T-cell-independent cytokine networks, and aggressive tumour-like behaviour of rheumatoid synovium have also been implicated. More recently, the contribution of autoantibodies has returned to the forefront. Based on the pathogenic mechanisms, specific therapeutic interventions can be designed to suppress synovial inflammation and joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis.},

	abstract = {Objective. To determine if there is any merit in measuring peak load duration in studies of boneâ€“implant interface during a pull-out test was performed to record the interfacial shear load. Design. Mechanical and histological investigations were performed to determine the boneâ€“implant interfacial strength. Background. A common long-term problem following artificial joint replacement is the formation of an intervening fibrous tissue seam at the interface between bone and a prosthesis. To investigate the nature and strength of interfacial attachment between bone and an implanted biomaterial, a detaching method such as pull-out test can be used. Methods. Four porous surfaced alumina ceramic implants with or without glass-ceramic containing apatite and wollastonite coating at the surface of the beads and the substrate were implanted into canine the femoral condyles. Peak value and its duration of the interfacial shear load for the different types of implants were analyzed. Tissue formed at the boneâ€“implant interfaces were examined histologically. Results. The peak value of interfacial shear load of the apatite and wollastonite glass-ceramic-coated implant was significantly greater than that of the non-coated implant at every stage, but the peak value duration in the control at each time period was greater than that of the coated implant. Histologically, more bone tissue ingrowth in the pores of coated implants, whereas a gap was observed at the interface of bone and the non-coated implant. Conclusions. The interfacial shear load values, peak and its duration, are significantly influenced by the direct bone bonding or the intervening fibrous tissue which formed at the boneâ€“implant interface. Relevance The peak load measurement and the duration of the peak load value are useful to measure the strength of interfacial attachment between bone and an implanted biomaterial. However, the duration of peak load value is closely related to the strength and plasticity of the tissue formed in the boneâ€“implant interface. The analysis of peak value duration could be used to determine the properties of new grown tissue before histologic examination.},

The stability of a revision tibial prosthesis was measured using a mechanical surrogate of the revision tibia, while varying the defect treatment proximally and the cortical engagement distally. An offset axial load in combination with an axial torque were applied to each specimen to simulate the stance phase of gait. It was found that, in revision total knee arthroplasty, the mechanical stability of tibial fixation is increased by the addition of a canal filling stem, especially in the presence of poor proximal bone. Proximal tibial coverage, even with a custom-fitted tibial component, adds little additional stability to a tibial tray stabilized by intramedullary engagement of a canal-filling stem.},

Two different types (Endo SL, FMT) were implanted into seven pairs of fresh-frozen human femoral specimens.

Dynamic mechanical loading was applied for 50,000 cycles while recording relative motions between stem and bone stock using a 3-D motion analysis system. The Endo SL stem showed a significantly higher amplitude of relative motion in all translational and rotational components regardless of the head used. In both stem types a strong tendency for higher axial migration with the diameter 50 mm head in comparison to the THA head was found. The lowest axial migration was found in the FMTstem in combination with the small head and a PE cup. The highest axial migration was found in the Endo SL stem combined with the diameter 50 mm head.

	abstract = {Abstract: A laboratory intercomparison of organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) measurements of atmospheric particulate matter samples collected on quartz filters was conducted among eight participants of the ACE-Asia field experiment. The intercomparison took place in two stages: the first round of the intercomparison was conducted when filter samples collected during the ACE-Asia experiment were being analyzed for OC and EC, and the second round was conducted after the ACE-Asia experiment and included selected samples from the ACE-Asia experiment. Each participant operated ECOC analyzers from the same manufacturer and utilized the same analysis protocol for their measurements. The precision of OC measurements of quartz fiber filters was a function of the filter's carbon loading but was found to be in the range of 4-13\% for OC loadings of 1.0-25 g of C cm-2. For measurements of EC, the precision was found to be in the range of 6-21\% for EC loadings in the range of 0.7-8.4 g of C cm-2. It was demonstrated for three ambient samples, four source samples, and three complex mixtures of organic compounds that the relative amount of total evolved carbon allocated as OC and EC (i.e., the ECOC split) is sensitive to the temperature program used for analysis, and the magnitude of the sensitivity is dependent on the types of aerosol particles collected. The fraction of elemental carbon measured in wood smoke and an extract of organic compounds from a wood smoke sample were sensitive to the temperature program used for the ECOC analysis. The ECOC split for the three ambient samples and a coal fly ash sample showed moderate sensitivity to temperature program, while a carbon black sample and a sample of secondary organic aerosol were measured to have the same split of OC and EC with all temperature programs that were examined.},

The diesel trucks are driven through the hot-start Federal Test Procedure (FTP) urban driving cycle on a transient chassis dynamometer. Emission rates of 52 gas-phase volatile hydrocarbons, 67 semivolatile and 28 particle-phase organic compounds, and 26 carbonyls are quantified along with fine particle mass and chemical composition. When all C1-C13 carbonyls are combined, they account for 60\% of the gas-phase organic compound mass emissions. Fine particulate matter emission rates and chemical composition are quantified simultaneously by two methods: a denuder/filter/PUF sampler and a traditional filter sampler. Both sampling techniques yield the same elemental carbon emission rate of 56 mg km-1 driven, but the particulate organic carbon emission rate determined by the denuder-based sampling technique is found to be 35\% lower than the organic carbon mass collected by the traditional filter-based sampling technique due to a positive vapor-phase sorption artifact that affects the traditional filter sampling technique. The distribution of organic compounds in the diesel fuel used in this study is compared to the distribution of these compounds in the vehicle exhaust. Significant enrichment in the ratio of unsubstituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) to their methyl- and dimethyl-substituted homologues is observed in the tailpipe emissions relative to the fuel. Isoprenoids and tricyclic terpanes are quantified in the semivolatile organics emitted from diesel vehicles. When used in conjunction with data on the hopanes, steranes, and elemental carbon emitted, the isoprenoids and the tricyclic terpanes may help trace the presence of diesel exhaust in atmospheric samples.},

Fine particle mass emission rates and fine particle elemental chemical composition were measured as well. Emission rates of 120 organic compounds, spanning carbon numbers from C1 to C29 were quantified including n-alkanoic acids, n-alkenoic acids, carbonyls, lactones, alkanes, aromatics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alkenes, and steroids. Ethylene, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde were found to be the predominant light gas-phase organic compounds emitted from the charbroiling operations. n-Alkanoic acids, n-alkenoic acids, and carbonyls made up a significant fraction of the quantified semivolatile and particle-phase organic compound emissions. Meat charbroiling is one of the few sources identified to date that contributes to the high molecular weight aldehydes measured in the urban atmosphere. Semivolatile and particle-phase organic compounds were collected for quantification by two simultaneous sampling protocols: (1) quartz fiber filters followed by polyurethane foam (PUF) cartridges, and (2) XAD-coated annular denuders followed by quartz fiber filters and PUF cartridges. Good agreement was observed for the total mass emissions collected by the two different sampling procedures; however, the partitioning of the semivolatile organic compounds between the gas phase and particle phase, as measured by the two sampling procedures, showed significant differences for n-alkanoic acids, indicating that significant artifact adsorption of these compounds occurs to the filter in the filter/PUF sampling system.},

The mean mass concentration of the sum of all investigated PAH in the sampled air at LKP (1.9-5.0 ng m-3) was roughly two times higher than at IWC (0.8-2.9 ng m-3), and at both locations it was about 2-3 times higher in winter (heating season) than in summer and spring or autumn. Comparisons with earlier measurement campaigns indicate a steep decrease of PAH abundance by almost an order of magnitude from 1980 to 1993 and a much slower decrease since then. Distinctly different seasonal trends and short-term fluctuations have been observed for semivolatile 3- and 4-ring PAH and for particle-bound 5- and 6-ring PAH. Based on systematic correlation analyses with a wide range of air quality parameters, most of the differences can be attributed to not only varying emissions but also chemical reactions with atmospheric oxidants which were found to play an important role. The results of denuder experiments prove that substantial degradation of the particularly toxic tracer benzo[a]pyrene and of the other investigated 5- and 6-ring PAH can occur during filter sampling and on airborne particles (formation of oxygenated and nitrated derivatives). Filter reaction artifacts are shown to lead to an underestimation of the actual PAH content of urban air particulate matter by up to 100\% of the measurement value or more, with a near-linear dependence on ozone volume mixing ratio. The role and applicability of ozone as a tracer of atmospheric oxidizing capacity for particle-bound PAH is discussed and confirmed by comparison with earlier investigations and by complementary laboratory experiments (reaction kinetics and product studies).},

The application of multigrid to unstructured grid problems, in which it is often difficult or impossible for the application to provide coarse grids, is not as well understood. In particular, methods that are designed to require only data that are easily available in most finite element applications (i.e. fine grid data), constructing the grid transfer operators and coarse grid operators internally, are of practical interest. We investigate three unstructured multigrid methods that show promise for challenging problems in 3D elasticity: (1) non-nested geometric multigrid, (2) smoothed aggregation, and (3) plain aggregation algebraic multigrid. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of these three methods on several unstructured grid problems in 3D elasticity with up to 76 million degrees of freedom.

From each of these two groups 100 hips (ninety-one patients in the Tharies group and eighty-six in the Trapezoidal-28 group) that had been followed for two to seven years were evaluated at the time of follow-up in accordance with a predetermined protocol. The patients were younger in the Tharies than in the Trapezoidal-28 group (average ages, fifty-eight and sixty-six years), included more men (sixty compared with thirty-five), and were more active postoperatively. The average follow-up was forty-seven months for the total joint-replacement group and thirty-eight months for the surface replacement group. At follow-up the ratings for pain, walking, and function according to the University of California at Los Angeles 10-point scale and the clinical results were identical in the two groups. Heterotopic ossification (Brooker grade III or IV) developed after thirteen Trapezoidal-28 and twenty-two Tharies arthroplasties. Radiographs made at six and twelve months and at final follow-up showed that the incidence of radiolucencies about the acetabular component was higher in the resurfacing group: fifty-seven with complete radiolucent lines after an average follow-up of thirty-eight months compared with thirty-six with complete lines after an average follow-up of forty-seven months. There were three failures in the joint-replacement group: a hematogenous staphylococcal deep infection that required a Girdlestone procedure, a femoral stem fracture that required revision, and loosening of an acetabular component for which revision was performed. There was also one dislocation, successfully treated by closed reduction. Similarly, in the resurfacing group there were three failures: two loose acetabular components, revised successfully, and one loose femoral component that necessitated total joint arthroplasty. Multivariate stepwise regression analysis showed that the factors that affected the final extent and width of the acetabular radiolucencies adversely after resurfacing were: any radiolucent lines that were visible at six months, a high level of physical activity after arthroplasty, and a thin superior cement mantle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Computational techniques and software for the analysis of problems in mechanics have naturally moved from their origins in the traditional engineering disciplines to the study of cell, tissue and organ biomechanics. Increasingly complex models have been developed to describe and predict the mechanical behavior of such biological systems. While the availability of advanced computational tools has led to exciting research advances in the field, the utility of these models is often the subject of criticism due to inadequate model verification and validation (V\&V). The objective of this review is to present the concepts of verification, validation and sensitivity studies with regard to the construction, analysis and interpretation of models in computational biomechanics. Specific examples from the field are discussed. It is hoped that this review will serve as a guide to the use of V\&V principles in the field of computational biomechanics, thereby improving the peer acceptance of studies that use computational modeling techniques.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional, neuromusculoskeletal model of the body was combined with dynamic optimization theory to simulate normal walking on level ground. The body was modeled as a 23 degree-of-freedom mechanical linkage, actuated by 54 muscles. The dynamic optimization problem was to calculate the muscle excitation histories, muscle forces, and limb motions subject to minimum metabolic energy expenditure per unit distance traveled. Muscle metabolic energy was calculated by slimming five terms: the basal or resting heat, activation heat, maintenance heat, shortening heat, and the mechanical work done by all the muscles in the model. The gait cycle was assumed to be symmetric; that is, the muscle excitations for the right and left legs and the initial and terminal states in the model were assumed to be equal. Importantly, a tracking problem was not solved. Rather only a set of terminal constraints was placed on the states of the model to enforce repeatability of the gait cycle. Quantitative comparisons of the model predictions with patterns of body-segmental displacements, ground-reaction forces, and muscle activations obtained from experiment show that the simulation reproduces the salient features of normal gait. The simulation results suggest that minimum metabolic energy per unit distance traveled is a valid measure of walking performance.},

	title = {Uncemented {STAR} total ankle prostheses. {Three} to eight-year follow-up of fifty-one consecutive ankles},
	volume = {85-A},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The feasibility of replacing the ankle joint has been a matter of speculation for a long time. In recent years, the designs of ankle prostheses have been improved, and three designs, all used without bone cement, currently dominate the market. However, documentation of the clinical results of the use of these prostheses is sparse. We reviewed the intermediate-term results of fifty-one consecutive Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacements (STAR). METHODS: Between 1993 and 1999, fifty-one consecutive ankles were replaced with an uncemented, hydroxyapatite-coated STAR total ankle prosthesis. Clinical examination for the present study was performed by one surgeon who had not taken part in the operations. Standardized radiographs were used. Complications and failures were recorded, and patient satisfaction and functional outcome scores were determined for all patients with an unrevised implant. RESULTS: Twelve ankles had to be revised. Seven were revised because of loosening of at least one of the components; two, because of fracture of the meniscus; and three, for other reasons. A component was exchanged in seven of the twelve revisions, whereas the ankle was successfully fused in the other five. An additional eight ankles had radiographic signs of loosening. The thirty-nine unrevised ankles (thirty-seven patients) were examined after thirty-six to ninety-seven months (median, fifty-two months). The patient was satisfied with the result after thirty-one of the ankle replacements, somewhat satisfied after two, and not satisfied after six. The median Kofoed score increased from 39 points before the surgery to 70 points at the time of the follow-up examination. A median follow-up score of 74 points was recorded when the system described by Mazur et al. and the AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society) system were used. The median range of motion was approximately the same preoperatively and postoperatively. The estimated five-year survival rate, with revision for any reason as the end point, was 0.70. When radiographic loosening of either component was used as the end point, the estimated five-year radiographic survival rate was significantly better for the last thirty-one ankles treated in the series (p = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Total ankle replacement may be a realistic alternative to arthrodesis, provided that the components are correctly positioned and are of the correct size. However, the risks of loosening and failure are still higher than are such risks after total hip or total knee replacement.},

This method can be used to identify the regions of close contact during dynamic motion, to calculate the surface area of subchondral bone within close contact, and to determine the changing position of the close contact area during dynamic activities. None of this informations can be obtained using other currently available 3D motion analysis techniques.

	abstract = {It is assumed that bone mineral density (BMD) measurement by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) has its limitation in identifying bone strength, and therefore other methods should be developed. Non-invasive strength measurement, which is needed to diagnose and monitor metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis, can become an alternative to current methods. In this study, mechanical vibration analysis was compared to BMD measured by DXA in human female tibia. Seven mother (Ms) and daughter (Ds) pairs' (total n = 14) left and right tibiae were evaluated by DXA and mechanical vibration analysis. Mechanical vibration analysis was consistent in the same bone and also in both sides. Correlation between BMD measured by DXA and vibration analysis was found in the Ds and Ms groups; the former being stronger than the latter. Natural frequencies of the Ms group were higher than that of the Ds group, and the response velocity of the Ds group was shorter than that of the Ms group. It is concluded that mechanical vibration analysis is consistent in bones and a correlation between BMD measured by DXA and vibration analysis can be established in young females that may be used in field studies to predict peak bone strength.},

Microdamage increases rapidly during the peak of the stress-strain curve, and a localized band of damage formed. At strains beyond the ultimate strain, the damaged band widened and the density of damage within the band increased. Microdamage occurred as groupings of cracks; the majority of damage occurred as regions of cross-hatching. All microdamage parameters increased with increasing maximum compressive strain. We also observed exponential relationships between crack numerical density and damage (1(o) - (o)Esec/E0) and between crack length density and damage.},

An ultrasonic technique is described with which mechanical properties of anisotropic, rigid, porous materials, such as cancellous bone, can be measured. The technique utilizes unique piezoelectric transducers operated in a continuous wave mode at a frequency of approximately 50 kHz. Both longitudinal and shear waves can be propagated and received with the transducers allowing both Young's moduli and shear moduli to be determined with the technique. A comparison between moduli measured with the ultrasonic technique and moduli measured with traditional mechanical testing shows the new method to be quite accurate in elastic property determination, (r2 = 0.935, Emech = 1.00E1dt + 23.3 MPa) (r2 = 0.656, Gmech = 1.08 Gult–3.3MPa).},

With this technique, it was possible to measure three orthogonal elastic moduli and three shear moduli from cubic specimens of cancellous bone as small as 8 mm per side. Correlation with mechanical tensile testing has shown this technique to offer a precise measure of cancellous modulus (Eten = 0.94Eult + 144.6 MPa, r2 = 0.96, n = 34). The cancellous bone of the proximal tibia was found to be very inhomogeneous, with the axial modulus ranging between 340 and 3350 MPa. A course map is presented, showing measured Young's moduli as a function of anatomical position. The anisotropy of the cancellous bone, determined by the relative differences between the three orthogonal moduli, was shown to be relatively constant over the entire range of cancellous densities tested. The relationship between the axial elastic modulus and the apparent density was found to be approximately linear, as reported by others for proximal tibial cancellous bone.},

The effects upon the stresses at the PMMA-bone interface and in the cancellous bone around the component due to the inclusion in the model of the cortical shell and the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the cancellous bone, are demonstrated. Various lengths of the fixation post are considered. The cortical shell adds support and stiffness to the bone structure, and allows generation of significant stresses proximally. The heterogeneity of the cancellous bone, as assumed here, dictates the form of the stress distributions and the magnitudes and locations of the peak stress values around the post of the component. Peak stress values can occur at locations proximal to the post tip. The anisotrophy of the cancellous bone significantly alters the magnitudes of the stresses. Lower stresses along the post interface and higher stresses beneath the plate of the prosthesis are seen in the anisotropic models. Lengthening of the fixation post reduces stresses proximally, but the effects of post lengthening upon the maximum stress values around the post are highly dependent upon the assumed properties of the cancellous bone.},

Tibiofemoral joint compression and soft tissue (ligament and muscle) forces were also included to better represent the loading condition in the tibia. Stress shielding effects were studied for a prosthesis similar to a commercially available model. Results from the model show that the hypothesis of relatively higher Young's modulus of implant compared to bone as the primary cause of stress shielding is not sufficiently descriptive. Loading conditions as a result of altered bone or implant condylar surface geometry, load placement on the condylar surface, and load pattern created by the TKR are at least as important or, in some cases, more important factors in observed stress shielding immediately post-operation. This finding can be used to focus new implant design on altered loading conditions as well as material selection.},

A three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) model has been developed to study bone and interface stresses for four different tibial prosthesis designs. The model described here incorporates orthotropic and heterogeneous bone properties with physiologically representative loading conditions. Results from this model indicate that stress distribution is affected by the incorporation of anisotropy and spatial variation of bone properties. All bone properties were mapped from published data to characterize their anisotropy and heterogeneity. Physiological loading was incorporated by mapping experimentally determined contact patterns. Convergence testing was performed to ensure model accuracy. In terms of interface forces, a tapered post decreased post shear while slightly increasing post compression compared to a cylindrical post; a post of elliptical cross-section increased post shear and decreased post compression. In terms of cancellous bone stress, tapered and elliptical posts both relieved compression compared to a cylindrical post, while a tapered post also produced increased peripheral stress. The inclusion of medial and lateral pegs in addition to a central fixation post caused localized stress shielding in the periphery of the pegs. In general, all implant models caused a reduction of cancellous bone stress plus high compression beneath the central fixation posts.},

	abstract = {Good femoral bone stock is important for the stability of the femoral component in revision knee arthroplasty. However, the primary total knee replacement (TKR) may cause significant loss of bone stock in the distal anterior femur. Earlier stress-induced bone remodelling simulations have suggested that a completely debonded component may save bone stock in the distal anterior region. However, these simulations did not consider the fixation of a debonded implant and possible secondary effects of micromotions and osteolysis at the interface. The current study tries to combine the preservation of bone stock with adequate component fixation. Different bone remodelling simulations were performed around femoral knee components with different sizes of bonding area and different friction characteristics of the debonded area. The fixation of the femoral component with different bonding characteristics is quantified with calculated implant-bone interface stresses. The results show that a bonded femoral component with a debonded inner side of the anterior flange may significantly reduce bone resorption in the endangered distal anterior femur, without jeopardizing the fixation of the femoral implant. This effect may be obtained in vivo by using a femoral component with a highly polished inner side of the anterior flange.},

	abstract = {A consecutive series of patients undergoing revision total knee arthroplasty was studied prospectively. Clinical and radiographic assessment was performed preoperatively, 6 and 12 months postoperatively, and annually thereafter. Evaluation consisted of a Knee Society clinical score and assessment of patient satisfaction. In addition, patients completed drawings of their lower extremity regarding the location and severity of the pain they experienced preoperatively and at minimum 2-year followup (mean, 36 months; range, 24-48 months). Pain that was localized to the diaphyseal region of the femur or tibia on the drawing was defined as pain at the end of the stem. Clinical, radiographic, and pain drawing data were completed for patients who had 66 of 78 revision total knee arthroplasties performed during the time of the study (85\%). All procedures were performed with the same implant system and instrumentation and included fluted cobalt-chrome stems for all patients in whom the stem was implanted without cement and slightly underreamed (press fit). All femoral components had the surface cemented with the stems press fit. Sixteen of the tibial stems were cemented fully, whereas the remaining 50 tibial components were cemented on the surface only with the stems press fit. Localized pain at the end of the stem was present on the femoral side in seven of 66 patients (11\%) and in seven of 50 patients with press fit tibial stems (14\%). Patients with pain at the end of the stem at 2 to 4 years postoperatively had significantly lower preoperative function scores and overall Knee Society clinical score. Postoperatively, patients with pain at the end of the stem had a significantly lower clinical score; however the postoperative function score and Knee Society clinical score were not significantly different than scores of patients who did not have pain at the end of the stem. There was no correlation between the stem diameter and the occurrence of pain; however, there was a trend for percent canal fill to be higher on the tibial side in patients with pain (71\% versus 63\%), but this was not statistically significant. Three of the 16 patients with cemented tibial stems (19\%) experienced pain at the end of the stem. Patients with press fit stems who had pain at the end of the stem were more likely to express dissatisfaction with the surgical procedure than patients without pain at the end of the stem.},

	issn = {0148-0731},
	abstract = {Despite the importance of multiaxial failure of trabecular bone in many biomechanical applications, to date no complete multiaxial failure criterion for human trabecular bone has been developed. By using experimentally validated nonlinear high-resolution, micromechanical finite-element models as a surrogate for multiaxial loading experiments, we determined the three-dimensional normal strain yield surface and all combinations of the two-dimensional normal-shear strain yield envelope. High-resolution finite-element models of three human femoral neck trabecular bone specimens obtained through microcomputed tomography were used. In total, 889 multiaxial-loading cases were analyzed, requiring over 41,000 CPU hours on parallel supercomputers. Our results indicated that the multiaxial yield behavior of trabecular bone in strain space was homogeneous across the specimens and nearly isotropic. Analysis of stress-strain curves along each axis in the 3-D normal strain space indicated uncoupled yield behavior whereas substantial coupling was seen for normal-shear loading. A modified super-ellipsoid surface with only four parameters fit the normal strain yield data very well with an arithmetic error +/-SD less than -0.04 +/- 5.1\%. Furthermore, the principal strains associated with normal-shear loading showed excellent agreement with the yield surface obtained for normal strain loading (arithmetic error +/- SD {\textless} 2.5 +/- 6.5\%). We conclude that the four-parameter "Modified Super-Ellipsoid" yield surface presented here describes the multiaxial failure behavior of human femoral neck trabecular bone very well.},

Based on the response to these loads, we found the tensor of elastic constants for an equivalent homogeneous elastic solid with cubic symmetry.

We postulate that genotype, systemic metabolic conditions, and local tissue interactions establish the level of local tissue mechanical stimulation (attractor state) appropriate for the maintenance of bone tissue. The net daily rate of apposition or resorption on a bone surface is determined by the difference between the actual stimulus and the tissue attractor state and can be modulated by other biologic factors. In calculating the net change in local bone apparent density, the technique takes into account the bone surface area available for osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity.

In addition CT and intraoperative penetration data were compared in 20 patients. If spatial agreement between CT and mechanical measurement sites is optimized, close correlations are found between the relative linear attenuation coefficient determined by CT and the ultimate strength (r = 0.84), the yield strength (r = 0.85), the elastic modulus (r = 0.78), the ultimate energy absorption (r = 0.83), the yield energy absorption (r = 0.81), and the penetration strength (r = 0.82).

	abstract = {The elastic constants of linearly elastic, isotropic or anisotropic bone material are required for many numerical simulations. These constants are often measured ultrasonically, but this can lead to mistakes, especially if shear modules of spongiosa are considered. The reason is that spongiosa is a structure composed of trabeculae, each of which acts as a kind of beam which allows longitudinal, shear and also bending waves to propagate; the bending waves are as fast as the longitudinal waves and are indistinguishable from the shear waves. Furthermore, mistakes in measuring Young's modulus cannot be avoided in every case. Several numerical simulations of wave propagations in homogeneous media, and especially in periodically and irregularly structured media, were carried out via the application of explicit finite element codes. Results showing the above-mentioned effects are presented and discussed. These can help to explain in detail why mistakes may occur during ultrasonic measurements.},

Mechanical tests were performed to load and dissociate humeral heads from the humeral stems (titanium). The effect of loading rate, load amplitude, and number of impactions was investigated. Dissociation force was measured after the taper was contaminated with water, oil, blood, and bone cement particles. The mean dissociation force after two impactions with a mallet was 2926 +/- 955 N. Dissociation force was linearly proportional to impaction force. Repetitive loading beyond two impactions did not significantly increase taper strength. Contamination of the taper with as little as 0.4 ml of fluid could prevent fixation of the taper.},

	abstract = {With the proportion of elderly people increasing in many countries, osteoporosis has become a growing public health problem, with rising medical, social, and economic consequences. It is well recognized that a combination of low bone mass and the deterioration of the trabecular architecture underlies osteoporotic fractures. A comprehensive understanding of the relationships between bone mass, the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of bone and bone function is fundamental to the study of new and existing therapies for osteoporosis. Detailed analysis of 3D trabecular architecture, using high-resolution digital imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance microimaging (MRmicroI), micro-computed tomography (microCT), and direct image analysis, has become feasible only recently. Rapid prototyping technology is used to replicate the complex trabecular architecture on a macroscopic scale for visual or biomechanical analysis. Further, a complete set of 3D image data provides a basis for finite element modeling (FEM) to predict mechanical properties. The goal of this paper is to describe how we can integrate three-dimensional microimaging and image analysis techniques for quantitation of trabecular bone architecture, FEM for virtual biomechanics, and rapid prototyping for enhanced visualization. The integration of these techniques provide us with an unique ability to investigate the role of bone architecture in osteoporotic fractures and to support the development of new therapies.},

Ten Lubinus SP2 stems cemented into bone specimens and 12 patients with the same stem design were used to evaluate the precision of stem translations and rotations. The precision of translations and rotations of the cup and femoral head penetration was studied in 12 patients with whole polyethylene cups.The use of a measurement method based on digitised radiographs improved the precision for some of the motion parameters, whereas many of them did not change. A corresponding pattern was observed for both the intra- and interobserver error. Of the wear parameters, the most pronounced improvements were the 3D wear and in the proximal-distal direction, although the anterior-posterior precision was also improved. The mean errors of rigid body and elliptic fitting decreased in all evaluations but one, consistent with a more reproducible identification of the markers centres and the edge of the femoral head.Increased precision of radiostereometric measurements may be used to increase the statistical power of future randomised studies and to study new fields in orthopaedics requiring higher precision than has been available with RSA based on manual measurements.},

Two of us, who were blinded to the clinical result, reviewed the radiographs retrospectively for the morphology of the proximal aspect of the femur; distal fit; metaphyseal fill; alignment of the stem; shedding of beads; distal cortical hypertrophy; pedestal formation; cancellous condensations at the distal end of the porous ingrowth surface; and the presence, extent, and location of radiolucent lines around the femoral component.

The urgency to advance knowledge in this area is motivated by the need to understand not only the causes of increased skeletal fragility with aging and disease, but also the mechanisms by which drugs reduce fracture risk. As reflected in the preceding articles, in the past decade collaborations between biologists, physicists, engineers and clinicians have led to new insights regarding the biological, material and structural features that contribute to skeletal fragility. Despite these new insights, important issues remain unresolved. Our challenges lie in identifying, describing and understanding the totality of features and characteristics that determine a bone's ability to resist fracture, and using this information to identify new therapeutic targets and develop better biomarkers and noninvasive imaging modalities. This summary is intended to integrate reports in the literature with presentations and discussions that occurred during the meeting, to highlight areas of consensus and those of continued controversy, and thus to identify critical areas for future research.},

	issn = {0884-0431},
	abstract = {We used QCT scans obtained in 687 men and women, 21-97 years of age, to estimate the factor of risk for vertebral fracture, Phi(vert), defined as the ratio of spinal loading to vertebral strength. With age, vertebral strength declined and Phi(vert) increased significantly more in women than men. Age- and sex-specific differences in Phi(vert) closely resembled previously reported vertebral fracture incidence. INTRODUCTION: Despite the high prevalence of vertebral fractures, little is known about the interaction between spinal loading and vertebral fragility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed the ratio of spinal loading to vertebral strength (i.e., the factor of risk, Phi(vert)) in an age- and sex-stratified population-based sample of 700 women and men 21-97 years of age. We measured volumetric BMD (vBMD, mg/cm3) and cross-sectional area (CSA, cm2) of the midvertebral bodies of L1-L3 using QCT and computed vertebral compressive strength from these data using engineering beam theory. A biomechanical model of the trunk was used to estimate compressive forces applied to the L3 vertebral body during standing, bending forward, and bending forward while lifting 10 kg. The factor of risk for fracture, Phi(vert), was computed as the ratio of spinal compressive force to vertebral strength for each activity. RESULTS: Men had a higher vertebral strength at all ages, largely because of their greater CSA. Whereas both sexes exhibited a marked decline in vertebral compressive strength with age (p {\textless} 0.001), the decline was greater in women than men (-43\% versus -31\%, p = 0.008). Compressive forces on L3 were greater in men than women, because of their greater body weight and height. For both sexes, forces during bending and lifting were 8-fold higher than those experienced during upright standing. For all activities, Phi(vert) increased with age, but significantly more so in women than men (p {\textless} 0.001). For bending and lifting, Phi(vert-bending) exceeded 1.0 in 30\% of women and 12\% of men {\textgreater} or =50 years of age, values that are similar to the reported frequency of vertebral fracture. CONCLUSION: These findings illustrate potential mechanisms underlying vertebral fractures and provide strong rationale for further evaluation of this QCT-based biomechanical approach for assessment of fracture risk.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to quantify mechanical and architectural changes to knee joint periarticular subchondral cancellous bone in early stage experimental osteoarthritis (OA). Unilateral anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLX) was performed on 10 dogs that were assigned randomly to two groups: 3 weeks or 12 weeks post-ACLX. Cylindrical bone cores excised from the medial condyle of the distal femur after death were scanned using high-resolution microcomputed tomography (muCT) and subsequently failed under unconstrained uniaxial compression. The apparent-level elastic modulus was less in the ACLX femur compared with the contralateral control, and the decrease was significant (-45\%; p {\textless} 0.05) by 12-weeks post-ACLX. A finite element (FE) analysis based on muCT data simulated the uniaxial compression tests on a specimen-by-specimen basis to determine tissue modulus. No change in tissue modulus was detected, and a single tissue modulus of 5100 MPa (95\% CI, +/- 600 MPa) explained the apparent-level modulus changes observed in the disease-related bone adaptation. The three-dimensional (3D) connectivity was evaluated from the original muCT data to quantify architectural alterations in contrast to tissue alterations. Significantly increased connectivity (through plate perforations) occurred as early as 3 weeks post-ACLX and was as high as 127\% by 12 weeks post-ACLX in the distal femur. These measured changes indicated that architectural adaptation predominated over tissue modulus changes affecting apparent-level elastic modulus in the early stage of experimental OA and suggests that to maintain normal cancellous bone after a traumatic injury, early intervention should focus on preventing the substantial architectural alterations.},

	abstract = {Abstract This review presents findings made in studies of large mammalian bones, especially from racehorse training experiments (2-8years old, third metacarpal, tarsal) and human autopsy orthopaedic femoral implant retrievals and other human biopsy and autopsy cases. Samples were cleaned to analyse mineralized matrix in three dimensions, or poly methyl-methacrylate embedded and micromilled to delete topography and study the superficial c.0.5-um two-dimensional section using quantitative backscattered electron imaging. With experimental implant studies in rabbits, observations were also made in vivo using confocal microscopy. Cracks in both calcified cartilage and bone may be removed by infilling with calcified matrix. This may be a general repair mechanism for calcified connective tissue crack repair. The fraction of the organ volume occupied by any form of bone tissue in equine distal third metacarpal extremities was increased in the more exercised groups by bone deposited within former marrow adipocytic space. Where deposited upon prior lamellar bone surfaces, this occurred without the intervention of prior resorption and without the formation of a hypermineralized cement line. Exercise inhibited osteoclastic resorption at external anatomical growth modelling sites where it normally occurs. Addition is not coupled to time-wasting resorption: both internally and externally, it occurs both by layering on existing cancellous surfaces and by creation of new immature scaffold, with de novo incorporation of a rich, capillary blood vessel supply. The real response within bone organs subjected to mechanical overload exercise within normal physiological limits is to make more, and to lose less, bone.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop and test a phantom model based on actual total hip replacement (THR) components to simulate the true penetration of the femoral head resulting from polyethylene wear. This model was used to study both the accuracy and the precision of radiostereometric analysis, RSA, in measuring wear. We also used this model to evaluate optimum tantalum bead configuration for this particular cup design when used in a clinical setting. A physical model of a total hip replacement (a phantom) was constructed which could simulate progressive, three-dimensional (3-D) penetration of the femoral head into the polyethylene component of a THR. Using a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) the positioning of the femoral head using the phantom was measured to be accurate to within 7 microm. The accuracy and precision of an RSA analysis system was determined from five repeat examinations of the phantom using various experimental set-ups of the phantom. The accuracy of the radiostereometric analysis, in this optimal experimental set-up studied was 33 microm for the medial direction, 22 microm for the superior direction, 86 microm for the posterior direction and 55 microm for the resultant 3-D vector length. The corresponding precision at the 95\% confidence interval of the test results for repositioning the phantom five times, measured 8.4 microm for the medial direction, 5.5 microm for the superior direction, 16.0 microm for the posterior direction, and 13.5 microm for the resultant 3-D vector length. This in vitro model is proposed as a useful tool for developing a standard for the evaluation of radiostereometric and other radiographic methods used to measure in vivo wear.},

	abstract = {Whole bone bending tests are commonly used in mechanical evaluation of long bones. Reliable information about the midshaft can only be obtained if the bending moment is uniformly distributed along the shaft, and if the distribution of the bending stress is not adversely influenced by rigid clamping of the bone ends. A testing device was developed to determine bending stiffness of long bones in 24 directions, perpendicular to the bone axis. For optimal distribution of bending moment and stress, four-point bending was performed, and bone ends were simply supported, not rigidly clamped. The method was validated by repeated testing of a stainless steel rod, and a sheep femur. Left-right ratios were assessed twice in 2 groups of 5 sheep: one control group, and one group in which the left femur was stabilized with a stainless steel interlocking nail for 2.5 yr, after a midshaft osteotomy. Test results obtained with the steel rod reproducibly were close to predicted values. Measurements with the sheep femurs were reproducible and precise for 3 of the 4 parameters of the bending test. Stiffness parameters were significantly higher in the operated sheep than in the control group. We conclude that the method described here provides accurate and reproducible information, which is representative for the long bone shaft.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine whether bicycle seats with anterior-medial cutouts influence pelvic angle, trunk angle, and comfort in female subjects during cycling. METHODS: Twenty female cyclists pedaled a stationary bicycle with their hands on the tops and drops of the handlebars under three different saddle conditions (standard, partial, and complete cutout designs). Pelvic angle was measured using an inclinometer attached to a caliper whereas trunk angle was quantified from digitization of video images. Comfort level was assessed subjectively by having participants rank the saddles from most to least comfortable. RESULTS: Anterior pelvic tilt angles for the partial and complete cutout saddles were 8\% and 16\% greater, respectively, than values for the standard saddle condition ( P {\textless} 0.05). Trunk flexion angles were greater for the complete versus standard and partial cutout designs ( P{\textless} 0.05). Participants displayed a 77\% greater anterior pelvic tilt angle and an 11\% greater trunk flexion angle in the drop versus top handlebar positions ( P {\textless} 0.05). A total of 55\% of the subjects ranked the partial cutout saddle as the most comfortable, and 30\% ranked the standard saddle as the most comfortable. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that partial and complete cutout saddle designs may increase anterior pelvic tilt, and saddles with a complete cutout design may increase trunk flexion angles under select cycling conditions. A saddle with a partial cutout design may be more comfortable than a standard or complete cutout saddle design.},

	abstract = {Endochondral ossification is the process of differentiation of cartilaginous into osseous tissue. Parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP), Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which are synthesized in different zones of the growth plate, were found to have crucial roles in regulating endochondral ossification. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the three growth factors PTHrP, Ihh and VEGF, together, could regulate longitudinal growth in a normal human, fetal femur. For this purpose, a one-dimensional finite element (FE) model, incorporating growth factor signaling, was developed of the human, distal, femoral growth plate. It included growth factor synthesis in the relevant zones, their transport and degradation and their effects. Simulations ran from initial hypertrophy in the center of the bone until secondary ossification starts at approximately 3.5 months postnatal. For clarity, we emphasize that no mechanical stresses were considered. The FE model showed a stable growth plate in which the bone growth rate was constant and the number of cells per zone oscillated around an equilibrium. Simulations incorporating increased and decreased PTHrP and Ihh synthesis rates resulted, respectively, in more and less cells per zone and in increased and decreased bone growth rates. The FE model correctly reflected the development of a growth plate and the rate of bone growth in the femur. Simulations incorporating increased and decreased PTHrP and Ihh synthesis rates reflected growth plate pathologies and growth plates in PTHrP-/- and Ihh-/- mice. The three growth factors, PTHrP, Ihh and VEGF, could potentially together regulate tissue differentiation.},

With the assistance of, the Thailand Mine Action Centre (TMAC) a study team visited Aranyaprathet Hospital from November 1, 2001 to November 10, 2001 to perform a clinical trial of the device. The study was conducted on 15 volunteer subjects to get early feedback on the compatibility of the foot with existing prosthetic systems and to determine the initial performance of the device. All patients were initially wearing SACH (Solid Ankle Cushion Heel) feet and Niagara feet were retrofitted onto the existing prosthesis systems. Although the Niagara foot could be fitted to wooden systems, it should not be used due to the high force demands on the connecting bolt assembly. From the study it was observed that most patients were able to appreciate the biomechanical differences of the Niagara foot compared to the SACH design. Although there was some initial concern regarding stability, these concerns likely reflected the flexibility of the Niagara foot and the energy return capabilities of it. The mechanism of the energy return system also explains comments regarding the Niagara foot such as â€ lighterâ€ and softerâ€. The main challenge with the Niagara foot is cosmesis. Although patients were satisfied with the performance of the Niagara foot, they were generally dissatisfied with the foot's ability to fit inside their current footwear.},

Orthopaedists try to prevent this disease by attempting to restore joint congruity, alignment, and stability; however, many patients have crippling joint pain and dysfunction develop despite optimal current treatment. The pathophysiology of posttraumatic osteoarthritis has not been explained. It is not simply the magnitude and type of injury that determines whether an injured articular surface will repair and remodel or undergo progressive degeneration. For these reasons, clinically significant progress in preventing posttraumatic osteoarthritis depends on advances in understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease that will make it possible to decrease the risk of articular surface degeneration and facilitate articular surface repair and remodeling. We examine the relationships between joint injury, repair and remodeling, and joint degeneration; the factors that increase the risk of posttraumatic joint degeneration; and, the questions that need additional investigation to develop treatments of joint injuries that will decrease the risk or severity of posttraumatic osteoarthritis.},

DESIGN: A cohort of 176 consecutive cases with no exclusions. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 6 years. SETTING: A university-affiliated institution specializing in elective orthopedic surgery. PARTICIPANTS: All 176 patients had arthritis of the knee, mainly osteoarthritis. All agreed preoperatively to prolonged postoperative follow-up. INTERVENTION: Noncemented total knee replacement with the Tricon M long-stem tibial component. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital for Special Surgery rating system for clinical results and degree of tibial sinkage and stem lucency seen radiologically. RESULTS: Eight (4.5\%) of the 176 prostheses required revision, none for sinkage. Of the remaining 168 knees, 156 (92.9\%) scored good or excellent, 6\% fair and 1.2\% poor. Sinkage occurred in 3\%, but was not of sufficient severity to require revision. No lucency was visible in 33.8\% of stems, partial lucency in 62\%, complete lucency with the lines being parallel to the stem in 3.5\% and complete lucency with divergent lines, indicating a loose implant, in 1.7\%. Lucency, when present, was seen mainly in the lateral view, seldom in the anteroposterior view. There was no correlation between radiologic results and clinical results. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a metaphyseal stem reduces the incidence of sinkage of the tibial component in total knee replacement. The stem largely solves the problem of mediolateral micromotion but does not completely prevent anteroposterior micromotion.},

A projected areal density, referred to as bone mineral density (BMD,g/cm2), is normally calculated to assess regional bone density and strength. We demonstrate that this measure can be misleading when used to compare bones of different sizes due to inherent biases caused by bone thickness differences. For example, assuming that volumetric bone density remains constant and bony linear dimensions are proportional to height, a 20\% increase in height would result in a 20\% increase in both the thickness and the BMD of any bone. We describe new analysis methods to reduce the confounding effect of bone size, and we introduce a parameter, bone mineral apparent density (BMAD, g/cm3), that better reflects bone apparent density. Using this parameter, we calculate a quantity that serves as an index of bone strength (IBS, g2/cm4) for whole vertebral bodies. These analyses were applied to lumbar spine (L2-4) DXA measurements in a population of women 17-40 years old and appear to offer advantages to conventional techniques.},

Results showed that bone fatigue is a gradual damage process accompanied by a progressive increase in hysteresis and a loss of bone stiffness. The total number of cycles to fatigue failure was influenced only by the total strain range and was not affected by mean strain. Bone was shown to have extremely poor fatigue resistance. Fully reversed cyclic loading to one half of the yield strain caused fatigue fracture in 1000 cycles. Biological implications. The bone regions which experience the highest strain ranges in vivo generally have a compressive mean strain.

The presence of marrow increased the strength, modulus, and energy absorption of specimens only at the highest strain rate of 10.0 per second. This enhancement of material properties at the highest strain rate was due primarily to the restricted viscous flow of marrow through the platen rather than the flow through the pores of the trabecular bone. In specimens without marrow, the strength was proportional to the square of the apparent density and the modulus was proportional to the cube of the apparent density. Both strength and modulus were approximately proportional to the strain rate raised to the 0.06 power. These power relationships, which were shown to hold for all bone in the skeleton, allow meaningful predictions of bone tissue strength and stiffness based on in vivo density measurements.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional finite element analysis is one of the best ways to assess stress and strain distributions in complex bone structures. However, accuracy in the results may be achieved only when accurate input information is given. A semi-automated method to generate a finite element (FE) model using data retrieved from computed tomography (CT) was developed. Due to its complex and irregular shape, the glenoid part of a left embalmed scapula bone was chosen as working material. CT data were retrieved using a standard clinical CT scanner (Siemens Somatom Plus 2, Siemens AG, Germany). This was done to produce a method that could later be utilized to generate a patient-specific FE model. Different methods of converting Hounsfield unit (HU) values to apparent densities and subsequently to Young's moduli were tested. All the models obtained were loaded using three-dimensional loading conditions taken from literature, corresponding to an arm abduction of 90 degrees. Additional models with different amounts of elements were generated to verify convergence. Direct comparison between the models showed that the best method to convert HU values directly to apparent densities was to use different equations for cancellous and cortical bone. In this study, a reliable method of determining both geometrical data and bone properties from patient CT scans for the semi-automated generation of an FE model is presented.},

	abstract = {Osteopontin (OPN) was expressed in murine wild-type osteoclasts, localized to the basolateral, clear zone, and ruffled border membranes, and deposited in the resorption pits during bone resorption. The lack of OPN secretion into the resorption bay of avian osteoclasts may be a component of their functional resorption deficiency in vitro. Osteoclasts deficient in OPN were hypomotile and exhibited decreased capacity for bone resorption in vitro. OPN stimulated CD44 expression on the osteoclast surface, and CD44 was shown to be required for osteoclast motility and bone resorption. Exogenous addition of OPN to OPN-/- osteoclasts increased the surface expression of CD44, and it rescued osteoclast motility due to activation of the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin. Exogenous OPN only partially restored bone resorption because addition of OPN failed to produce OPN secretion into resorption bays as seen in wild-type osteoclasts. As expected with these in vitro findings of osteoclast dysfunction, a bone phenotype, heretofore unappreciated, was characterized in OPN-deficient mice. Delayed bone resorption in metaphyseal trabeculae and diminished eroded perimeters despite an increase in osteoclast number were observed in histomorphometric measurements of tibiae isolated from OPN-deficient mice. The histomorphometric findings correlated with an increase in bone rigidity and moment of inertia revealed by load-to-failure testing of femurs. These findings demonstrate the role of OPN in osteoclast function and the requirement for OPN as an osteoclast autocrine factor during bone remodeling.},

Amongst uncemented prostheses, there was no difference in the survival or radiological outcome with the use of a stem as against two condylar pegs. The clinical need for revision may be predicted radiologically 3 years after operation in symptomless patients by noting a change in component position combined with progressive radiolucent lines and osteolysis. Thus, radiological follow-up should be continued for a minimum of 3 years after knee replacement. The use of a stem enabled the detection of radiolucent lines which we believe were missed around prostheses with condylar pegs. Thus, the use of a stem improves the prediction of failure (but does not improve fixation).},

Of the 115 revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) cases, the hybrid-fixation technique was used on both the femoral and tibial components of 75 (Group I-hybrid femur, hybrid tibia); the fully cemented technique was used on both components of 24 (Group II-cemented femur, cemented tibia); the hybrid-fixation technique was used on the femoral component and full cement on the tibial component of 13 (Group III-hybrid femur, cemented tibia); the femoral component was fully cemented, and tibial component had the hybrid-fixation technique used on 3 (Group IV-cemented femur, hybrid tibia). The average follow up was 44 (range: 24-126) months. At the most recent evaluation, the Knee Society score improved from an average preoperative value of 51.7 to 76.7, the pain score improved from 14.0 to 33.3, and the functional score improved from 40.5 to 47.0.

Radiolucent lines less than 2 cm were observed more frequently in the hybrid-cemented stems (89\%) than the fully cemented stems (58\%) at an average 8-year follow up postoperatively (p{\textless}0.05).

	abstract = {Vibrational loading can stimulate the formation of new trabecular bone or maintain bone mass. Studies investigating vibrational loading have often used whole-body vibration (WBV) as their loading method. However, WBV has limitations in small animal studies because transmissibility of vibration is dependent on posture. In this study, we propose constrained tibial vibration (CTV) as an experimental method for vibrational loading of mice under controlled conditions. In CTV, the lower leg of an anesthetized mouse is subjected to vertical vibrational loading while supporting a mass. The setup approximates a one degree-of-freedom vibrational system. Accelerometers were used to measure transmissibility of vibration through the lower leg in CTV at frequencies from 20 Hz to 150 Hz. First, the frequency response of transmissibility was quantified in vivo, and dissections were performed to remove one component of the mouse leg (the knee joint, foot, or soft tissue) to investigate the contribution of each component to the frequency response of the intact leg. Next, a finite element (FE) model of a mouse tibia-fibula was used to estimate the deformation of the bone during CTV. Finally, strain gages were used to determine the dependence of bone strain on loading frequency. The in vivo mouse leg in the CTV system had a resonant frequency of 60 Hz for +/-0.5 G vibration (1.0 G peak to peak). Removing the foot caused the natural frequency of the system to shift from 60 Hz to 70 Hz, removing the soft tissue caused no change in natural frequency, and removing the knee changed the natural frequency from 60 Hz to 90 Hz. By using the FE model, maximum tensile and compressive strains during CTV were estimated to be on the cranial-medial and caudolateral surfaces of the tibia, respectively, and the peak transmissibility and peak cortical strain occurred at the same frequency. Strain gage data confirmed the relationship between peak transmissibility and peak bone strain indicated by the FE model, and showed that the maximum cyclic tibial strain during CTV of the intact leg was 330+/-82muepsilon and occurred at 60-70 Hz. This study presents a comprehensive mechanical analysis of CTV, a loading method for studying vibrational loading under controlled conditions. This model will be used in future in vivo studies and will potentially become an important tool for understanding the response of bone to vibrational loading.},

	abstract = {Clinicians and patients would benefit if accurate methods of predicting and monitoring bone strength in-vivo were available. A group of 51 human femurs (age range 21-93; 23 females, 28 males) were evaluated for bone density and geometry using quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Regional bone density and dimensions obtained from QCT and DXA were used to develop statistical models to predict femoral strength ex vivo. The QCT data also formed the basis of a three-dimensional finite element (FE) models to predict structural stiffness. The femurs were separated into two groups; a model training set (n = 25) was used to develop statistical models to predict ultimate load, and a test set (n = 26) was used to validate these models. The main goal of this study was to test the ability of DXA, QCT and FE techniques to predict fracture load non-invasively, in a simple load configuration which produces predominantly femoral neck fractures. The load configuration simulated the single stance phase portion of normal gait; in 87\% of the specimens, clinical appearing sub-capital fractures were produced. The training/test study design provided a tool to validate that the predictive models were reliable when used on specimens with "unknown" strength characteristics. The FE method explained at least 20\% more of the variance in strength than the DXA models. Planned refinements of the FE technique are expected to further improve these results. Three-dimensional FE models are a promising method for predicting fracture load, and may be useful in monitoring strength changes in vivo.},

	abstract = {Models which are based on non-invasive bone measurements may in the future be able to successfully identify individual subjects at an increased risk for hip fracture; thus, we designed a study to determine the usefulness of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) in predicting the local material properties of human proximal femoral cancellous bone. There has been some disagreement in the scientific literature regarding appropriate predictive models for local material properties of cancellous bone. We sought to confirm that density-mechanical property relationships were consistent from subject to subject, and that three-dimensional QCT measurements were stronger predictors of mechanical properties than two-dimensional DXA results. Linear and power fit relationships between these densitometric measures and material properties were also examined to determine which were more appropriate. Bone cubes from specific regions of highly oriented trabeculae were analyzed separately to determine if cube orientation had an effect on mechanical properties independent of bone density. Ten pairs of ex vivo femurs (five male, five female; age 30-93, mean age 62) were prepared such that specific anatomic planes were visible radiographically. Both QCT and DXA measurements were made on all 20 femurs. Cancellous bone cubes were obtained proceeding along two distinct directions from the proximal end of each femur pair. Unexpectedly, the density-modulus relationships among these ten donors were found to be significantly different at p {\textless}0.01 (83 percent of the tests were different at p {\textless}0.0001). Density-strength regressions were also significantly different at p {\textless}0.01, but this effect was not as consistent nor as statistically significant. In general, the QCT method did not produce predictions of local cancellous bone material properties superior to the DXA method. The linear and power fit models appeared to produce consistent results, with neither being obviously more advantageous. These density measurements explained at best 30-40 percent of the variance in modulus and 50-60 percent of the variance in ultimate stress. The orientation of cancellous cubes in the principal compressive trabeculae region was a significant contributor to mechanical properties (p= 0.0001) independent of bone density. This finding was not as dramatic in the femoral neck cancellous bone region.},

The evolution of the total hip from the one-piece, all-polyethylene acetabular component and fixed-head femoral component to the myriad of parts that comprise many of today's total hip designs has brought with it an array of potential mechanisms for failure that were not present in the earlier design. The risk/benefit ratio of these new designs may need to be reevaluated based on the additional mechanisms for failure that they provide. One hundred eleven acetabular hip prostheses and 139 femoral prostheses, all of modular configuration, retrieved by surgeons in the field, and sent for histologic examination, were analyzed for this study. A number of component characteristics were found to be correlated to early failure. These included acetabular designs with thin polyethylene bearings, poor fixation of the polyethylene to the metal shell, and geometries that permitted a moment to be applied to the bearing insert, tending to cause it to rotate in the metal shell. Modular femoral components were observed to be susceptible to corrosion, with titanium-alloy stems mated to cast cobalt-alloy heads at greatest risk attributable to a galvanic effect. All modular connections of femoral and acetabular components are at risk for disassociation and fretting; therefore, clever design and precision machining are necessary to produce prostheses in which the benefits of modularity exceed the risks.},

	abstract = {This work is a review of recent advances in the understanding of strain adaptive bone remodeling. The phenomenological theories of surface bone strain adaptation and internal bone strain adaptation are summarized as well as the possible cellular mechanisms for mechanotransduction that occurs in bone tissue adaptation. The phenomenological bone strain adaptation theories are based on the postulate that there exists a causal relationship between the rate of deposition or resorption of the bone matrix and a stimulus; the stimuli considered are generally measures of the mechanical loading (strain, strain rate, strain energy, stress, fatigue microdamage) applied to the bone matrix of a whole living bone. The exact measure of the mechanical loading history at a point that is the biological stimulus, although much discussed and written about, is not precisely known. The focus of this review is to highlight our ignorance concerning the nature of precise biological stimulus and to suggest ways to deal with this ignorance.},

	abstract = {A continuum model is proposed to describe the temporal evolution of both the density changes and the reorientation of the trabecular architecture given the applied stress state in the bone and certain material parameters of the bone. The data upon which the proposed model is to be based consist of experimentally determined remodeling rate coefficients and quantitative stereological and anisotropic elastic constant measurements of cancellous bone. The model shows that the system of differential equations governing the temporal changes in architecture is necessarily nonlinear. This nonlinearity is fundamental in that it stems from the fact that, during remodeling, the relationship between stress and strain is changing as the stress and strain variables themselves are changing. In order to preserve the remodeling property of the model, terms that are of the order strain times the changes in density and/or microstructural properties must be retained. If these terms were dropped, there would be no feedback mechanism for architectural adaptation and no adaptation of the trabecular architecture. There is, therefore, no linearized version of the model of the temporal evolution of trabecular architecture. An application of the model is illustrated by an example problem in which the temporal evolution of homogeneous trabecular architecture is predicted. A limitation of the proposed continuum model is the length scale below which it cannot be applied. The model cannot be applied in regions of cancellous bone where the trabecular bone architecture is relatively inhomogeneous or at a bone-implant interface.},

	title = {In vitro testing of a novel limb salvage prosthesis for the distal femur},
	volume = {13},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to define strain pattern in the host bone following distal femoral resection and implantation of a massive prosthesis. Two methods of coupling the prosthesis to the bone were compared: the Compliant Pre-Stress device, and a standard cemented tumour prosthesis. DESIGN: The composite femur model was selected to minimize variables. Four femurs were tested before and after implantation. Both coaxial and cantilever loading were applied. BACKGROUND: Cemented distal femoral replacement following resection of malignant tumours has a high failure rate at 5 years and is associated with extensive bone resorption thought to be secondary to stress shielding. METHODS: Strain was measured in the medial and lateral sides at four levels with physiologic loads applied, in the intact, Compliant Pre-Stress, and cemented femurs. Repeated measurements were taken. Strains in the implanted femur were calculated as percentage of the intact, and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The most reproducible results were noted in cantilever bending (variability {\textless}5\%). The Compliant Pre-Stress device demonstrated a more physiologic strain pattern than the cemented stem. The most significant difference between the two implants was in the area adjacent to the interface. CONCLUSIONS: The Compliant Pre-Stress device shows less stress shielding than a standard cemented implant. The protocol described and the use of composite femurs demonstrated reproducible results. RELEVANCE: Massive prosthesis are commonly used following tumour resection or removal of failed primary joint replacement prostheses. The failure rate for aseptic loosening for cemented implants is 25\% at 5 years with significant bone resorption about the implant. Compliant Pre-Stress is an innovative technology that allows coupling of metallic implants to bone with little stress shielding. This paper aims to define the strain patterns about the implant and compare them to a standard cemented device. The reduced stress shielding of the Compliant Pre-Stress fixation system should guarantee reduced bone loss around the implant and help to obtain improved clinical results.},

	abstract = {When a cemented orthopaedic device is being investigated there is a need to estimate the forces at the cement-prosthesis interface. For this reason a miniature transducer was developed that could be included inside the surface of most prostheses. A load cell (based on a piezoelectric sensor) and the required accessories and amplification were custom designed and built.The present work describes the validation that was performed on the piezo sensors alone, when mounted on a simplified structure, and when applied to a hip stem.Linearity, repeatability, reproducibility, and sensibility to shear and axial eccentric loads were tested, yielding satisfactory results. The repeatability on the same sensor was found to be good while reproducibility between sensors was lower. Thus, each sensor was calibrated separately with a second order relationship. Sensitivity to shear and eccentric loads was very low.The overall accuracy of the load cell (including non-linearity, and signal drift) was of the order of about 1\%.A hip stem instrumented with four such sensors was successfully implanted in a composite femur, yielding meaningful readouts.Thus, this type of sensor can readily be used to assess the cement-prosthesis interface forces in cemented devices.},

Were such a relationship to exist this would provide a noninvasive method of assessing the quality of bone in the regions of fixation of implants to bone. The data would be of considerable aid to designers of implant stems to withstand the stresses arising at its interface with the bone. Five pairs of fresh frozen human femora were used. Several beam-shaped small specimens were methodically harvested from each pair and were used to measure the longitudinal modulus adopting the three-point bending test, which was carried out with a specially constructed and validated apparatus. CT scans of the bone were obtained, prior to harvesting the specimens, and the CT number was measured at locations corresponding with the specimen sites. The results indicate that in the femoral midshaft the cortical bone has an average Young's modulus value of 18600 +/- 1900 MPa. This agrees well with data obtained by other researchers using different experimental methods. Statistical analyses revealed no regional variations in the value of the longitudinal modulus of the bone. No correlation was found between the bone modulus and the CT number. Thus a noninvasive method for establishing the bone properties still remains a challenge.},

	abstract = {The covariation of a number of mechanical of properties, and some physical characteristics, of compact bones from a wide range of bones were examined. Young's modulus was well predicted by a combination of mineral content and porosity. Increasing Young's modulus was associated with: increasing stress at yield, increasing bending strength, and a somewhat higher resilience, tensile strength and fatigue strength. Contrarily, in the post-yield region a higher Young's modulus (and more clearly, a higher mineral content) was associated with: a reduced work to fracture in tension, a reduced impact strength and an increased notch sensitivity in impact. Increasing porosity is associated with deleterious effects in the pre-yield region, but has little effect in the post-yield region. Bone, like many other materials, is unable to have good qualities in both the pre- and post-yield regions. Since an increase in mineral or Young's modulus is more potent, that is deleterious, in the post-yield than it is advantageous in the pre-yield region, it is likely that mineral content will be selected to be slightly lower than would be the case if it were equally potent in both regions. As is usual in biology, different adaptive extremes are incompatible.},

	abstract = {Screwed acetabular cups, applied in total hip replacements, generate stresses in the surrounding bone during implantation (prestresses). The effect of these prestresses on the endurance of the hip replacement are unknown. The prestresses in the acetabulum were examined both experimentally, using strain gauge techniques, and numerically, using the finite element method. It was found that the prestresses were of the same order of magnitude, if not larger, than the stresses due to the hip reaction force during one-legged stance. In some cases, the prestresses even approximated the ultimate tensile strength of cortical bone. The prestresses seemed to have a strong dependence on the outer shape of the cup, rather than on the flexibility of the cup or whether the cup had a self-cutting thread or not. Furthermore, it was found that the prestresses are not very susceptible to stress relaxation due to the visco-elastic behaviour of bone. This means that prestresses will remain present over long periods of time. So even when a patient has resumed normal daily activities, the prestresses will still play an important role in the overall stress distributions around the acetabulum. Due to the interaction of prestresses and stresses due to normal loading, the primary stability of a metal-backed screwed cup is better guaranteed than the primary stability of an all-polyethylene screwed cup.},

	volume = {26},
	issn = {0021-9290},
	abstract = {So far, virtually nothing is known about the mechanical properties of pelvic trabecular bone. In this study, several techniques have been used to establish some insight in these properties. Dual-energy quantitative computer tomography (DEQCT) was used to look at the distribution of bone densities throughout the pelvic bone and nondestructive mechanical testing was used to obtain Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios in three orthogonal directions for cubic specimens of pelvic trabecular bone. The same specimens were then used for stereological measurements to obtain volume fractions and the spatial orientations of the mean intercept lengths. The combined data on the mechanical tests and the stereological measurements made it possible to calculate Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios for the specimens' principal material axes. DEQCT showed that bone densities within a pelvic bone are significantly higher in the superior part of the acetabulum, extending to the sacroiliac joint area and, secondly, in the area of the pubic symphysis. Volume fractions found for the specimens did not exceed 20\%. This may be considered rather low when compared to values reported in the literature for trabecular bone of femoral or tibial origin, but the values do lie in the same range as vertebral trabecular bone. With the volume fraction as its primary predictor, values of Young's moduli were also low. For most specimens these values were not higher than 100 MPa, with an occasional peak of 250 MPa. Looking at the ratio of the highest and lowest Young's modulus or at the components of the fabric tensor, it can be concluded that pelvic trabecular bone is not highly anisotropic. On an average, Poisson's ratio was found to be closer to 0.2 rather than 0.3, which is in accordance with other studies on Poisson's ratio of trabecular bone.},

	abstract = {Failure of bone adaptation to protect the skeleton from fatigue fracture is common, and site-specific accumulation and coalescence of microcracking in regions of high strain during cyclic loading is considered a key factor that decreases the resistance of whole bones to fracture. We investigated the effect of cyclic fatigue loading on the monotonic structural properties of the rat ulna during accumulation and coalescence of microcracks. Cyclic end-loading of the ulna was performed at 4 Hz ex vivo at an initial peak strain of -6000 muepsilon to 20\% loss of stiffness (n = 7) or 40\% loss of stiffness (n = 7) bilaterally. A 0\% loss of stiffness monotonically loaded control group (n = 7) was also included. Volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD), ultimate strength (F(u)), stiffness (S), and energy-to-failure (U) were determined in one ulna and in the contralateral ulna vBMD, cortical bone area (B.Ar), maximum and minimum second moments of inertia (I(MAX) and I(MIN)), microcrack density (Cr.Dn), microcrack mean length (Cr.Le), and microcrack surface density (Cr.S.Dn) were determined. In two additional groups of rats, cyclic end-loading of the ulna was also performed ex vivo unilaterally to 20\% loss of stiffness (n = 10) and 40\% loss of stiffness (n = 10) and then vBMD, F(u), S, U, B.Ar, I(MAX), and I(MIN) were determined bilaterally. Fatigue loading had incremental degradative effects on ulna structural properties. This decreased resistance to fracture was associated with accumulation and coalescence of branching arrays of microcracks within the cortex of the ulna. Microcracking was most prominent in the middiaphysis and corresponded to the region of the bone that fractured during monotonic structural testing. Fatigue loading influenced the relationship between bone cross-sectional geometry and vBMD and ulna structural properties. At 40\% loss of stiffness, F(u), S, and U were all significantly correlated with cross-sectional bone geometry and vBMD, whereas this was not the case at 20\% loss of stiffness and with the 0\% loss of stiffness monotonic control ulnae. We also found a biologically significant individual animal effect. Larger ulnae required a higher number of load cycles for fatigue to develop, retained higher strength, and accumulated a greater amount of microcracking at the end of the cyclic fatigue testing. Small increases in bone size and density can substantially improve the resistance of whole bones to fracture as microcracking accumulates and coalesces during cyclic fatigue loading.},

However, most analyses within the field of biomechanics usually take no account either of the wide variation in material properties and geometry that may occur in natural tissues or manufacturing imperfections in synthetic materials. This paper discusses two different methods of incorporating uncertainty in FE models. The first, Taguchi's robust parameter design, uses orthogonal matrices to determine how to vary the parameters in a series of FE models, and provides information on the sensitivity of a model to input parameters. The second, probabilistic analysis, enables the distribution of a response variable to be determined from the distributions of the input variables. The methods are demonstrated using a simple example of an FE model of a beam that is assigned material properties and geometry over a range similar to an orthopaedic fixation plate. In addition to showing how each method may be used on its own, we also show how computational effort may be minimised by first identifying the most important input variables before determining the effects of imprecision.},

METHODS: The estimates are based on data collected through the National Hospital Discharge Survey. The survey has been conducted annually since 1965. In 2005, data were collected for approximately 375,000 discharges. Of the 473 eligible nonfederal short-stay hospitals in the sample, 444 (94 percent) responded to the survey. RESULTS: An estimated 34.7 million discharges from nonfederal short-stay hospitals occurred in 2005. Discharges used 165.9 million days of care and had an average length of stay of 4.8 days. Persons 65 years and over accounted for 38 percent of the hospital discharges and 44 percent of the days of care. The proportion of discharges whose status was described as routine discharge or discharged to the patient's home declined with age, from 91 percent for inpatients under 45 years of age to 41 percent for those 85 years and over. Hospitalization for malignant neoplasms decreased from 1990-2005. The hospitalization rate for asthma was the highest for children under 15 years of age and those 65 years of age and over. The rate was lowest for those 15-44 years of age. Thirty-eight percent of hospital discharges had no procedures performed, whereas 12 percent had four or more procedures performed. An episiotomy was performed during a majority of vaginal deliveries in 1980 (64 percent), but by 2005, it was performed during less than one of every five vaginal deliveries (19 percent).},

	abstract = {The experimental evaluation of any total knee replacement (TKR) design should include the pre-implantation quantification of its mechanical performance during tests that simulate the common activities of daily living. To date, few dynamic TKR simulation studies have been conducted before implantation. Once in vivo, the accurate and reproducible assessment of TKR design mechanics is exceedingly difficult, with the secondary variables of the patient and the surgical technique hindering research. The current study utilizes a 6-degree-of-freedom force-controlled knee simulator to quantify the effect of TKR design alone on TKR mechanics during a simulated walking cycle. Results show that all eight TKR designs tested elicited statistically different measures of tibial/femoral kinematics, simulated soft tissue loading, and implant geometric restraint loading during an identical simulated gait cycle, and that these differences were a direct result of TKR design alone. Maximum ranges of tibial kinematics over the eight designs tested were from 0.8mm anterior to 6.4mm posterior tibial displacement, and 14.1 degrees internal to 6.0 degrees external tibial rotation during the walking cycle. Soft tissue and implant reaction forces ranged from 106 and 222N anteriorly to 19 and 127N posteriorly, and from 1.6 and 1.8Nm internally to 3.5 and 5.9Nm externally, respectively. These measures provide valuable experimental insight into the effect of TKR design alone on simulated in vivo TKR kinematics, bone interface loading and soft tissue loading. Future studies utilizing this methodology should investigate the effect of experimentally controlled variations in surgical and patient factors on TKR performance during simulated dynamic activity.},

	abstract = {Despite a general understanding that bone microdamage has distinct strain dependent morphologies, very little information exists on how different damage morphologies develop and participate in bone fracture. In this study, cortical bone beams were subjected to the primary or tertiary phases of bending fatigue followed by either post-hoc fracture toughness tests or microdamage analysis to determine the sequence in which linear microcracks and diffuse damage form during bending fatigue and how they affect the propensity of bone to fracture. The results demonstrate that, following the primary phase, linear microcracks and diffuse damage are formed on the compressive and tensile sides, respectively (p{\textless}0.05). Furthermore, this mode of damage formation results in a greater toughness loss if a fracture crack initiates from the tensile side rather than the compressive side (p{\textless}0.05). Continued loading of bone specimens to the tertiary phase, however, leads to further accumulation of damage only on the compressive side (p{\textless}0.05), and this mode of damage formation results in a further toughness loss if a fracture crack initiates from the compressive side rather than the tensile side (p{\textless}0.05). Thus, cortical bone compartmentalizes the damage morphologies in different regions and the sequence of damage production in different phases of cyclic loading to dissipate energy and resist a catastrophic fracture.},

	volume = {79},
	abstract = {We reviewed our experience with total knee arthroplasties performed between 1977 and 1992 in patients who were fifty-five years old or less to determine the appropriate management for younger patients who have severe osteoarthrosis. One hundred and fourteen knee replacements were performed in eighty-eight patients who were an average of fifty-one years old (range, twenty-two to fifty-five years old). All of the operations were performed by one of the two senior ones of us (J. N. I. or W. N. S.) with the use of cementing techniques. A posterior stabilized, posterior cruciate-substituting design was used for all but one replacement, for which a semiconstrained total condylar prosthesis was used. Six knees (four patients) were lost to follow-up. Follow-up data for the remaining 108 knees (eighty-four patients) were used to perform the survivorship analysis. One hundred and three unrevised knees (eighty patients) were available for clinical evaluation with the scoring systems of The Hospital for Special Surgery and the Knee Society at an average of eight years (range, three to eighteen years) postoperatively; thirty-six knees were followed for more than ten years. In addition, the activity levels of the patients were assessed with the activity score of Tegner and Lysholm. Radiographs were examined for evidence of loosening of the component. At the latest follow-up examination, the average knee score according to the system of The Hospital for Special Surgery had improved from 55 points preoperatively to 92 points. According to the system of the Knee Society, the average knee score was 94 points and the average functional score was 89 points. The result for all 103 knees was good or excellent according to the knee scores of The Hospital for Special Surgery and the Knee Society. Ninety-seven knees (94 per cent) had good or excellent function according to the functional score of the Knee Society. The average activity score of Tegner and, Lysholm improved from 1.3 points (range, 0 to 4 points) preoperatively to 3.5 points (range, 1 to 6 points) at the latest follow-up examination. All but two patients had improvement in the activity score postoperatively, and nineteen (24 per cent) of the eighty patients had an activity score of at least 5 points, indicating regular participation in activities such as tennis, skiing, bicycling, or strenuous farm or construction work. Nine (9 per cent) of the 103 knees had non-progressive tibial radiolucent lines. Two patients had a revision because of late infection, and one patient had revision of a well fixed tibial component because of wear of the polyethylene. In addition, three patellar components were revised for loosening, and one spacer was exchanged to treat instability. With failure defined as revision of either the femoral or the tibial component, the over-all rate of survival was 94 per cent at eighteen years. When the three patellar revisions were included in the failures, the survival rate was 90 per cent at eighteen years. When the exchange of the spacer was also included in the failures, the survival rate was 87 per cent at eighteen years. We consider arthroplasty with cementing of a posterior stabilized total knee prosthesis to be effective operative treatment with durable results for osteoarthrosis in younger patients when other, less invasive measures have failed. Within the average eight-year follow-up interval of this study, polyethylene wear, osteolysis, and loosening of the conforming posterior cruciate-substituting prosthesis were not major problems for these younger, active patients, although it is possible that this observation could change with an even longer duration of follow-up.},

Superolateral relocation of the acetabular component increases the hip joint reaction forces and has been associated with early femoral implant loosening. In addition, relocation can necessitate the use of extended femoral neck lengths. The purpose of this study was to compare the initial stability (micromotion) of an anatomically placed femoral component with that of a superolaterally relocated component and with a component having an extended neck length. A six-degree of freedom device was constructed to measure three-dimensional micromotion at the proximal and distal regions of the femoral component. The instrumented femur was loaded using a unique loading device that included musculature necessary to simulate stairclimbing. Results showed that superolateral relocation of the hip center (25 mm) only moderately increased femoral component micromotion (13\%). However, it was found that extending the neck length 12.5 mm produced a dramatic increase in micromotion (38\%). Clinically this suggests that hip center lateralization and the use of long modular neck lengths should be avoided.},

	abstract = {Partitioning a daily mechanical stimulus into discrete loading bouts enhances bone formation in rat tibiae (J. Bone Mineral Res. 15(8) (2000) 1596). We hypothesized that a refractory period exists in primary rat osteoblastic cells, during which fluid-flow-induced [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations are insensitive to additional short bouts (2 min) of fluid flow. Because the frequency of [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations is believed to be important for regulating cellular activity and long-term fluid flow alters gene expression in bone cells, we also hypothesized that long-term (15 min) oscillating fluid flow produces multiple [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations in osteoblastic cells. Primary osteoblastic cells from rat long bones were exposed to 2 min of oscillating fluid flow that produced shear stresses of 2 Pa at 2 Hz. After a rest period of 5, 30, 60, 300, 600, 900, 1800, or 2700 s, the cells were exposed to a second 2-min bout of flow. A 600 s rest period was required to recover the percentage of cells responding to fluid flow and a 900 s rest period was required to recover the [Ca(2+)](i) oscillation magnitude. The magnitude and shape of the two [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations were strikingly similar for individual cells after a 900 s rest period. During 15 min of continuous oscillating flow, some individual cells displayed between 1 and 9 oscillations subsequent to the initial [Ca(2+)](i) oscillation. However, only 54\% of the cells that responded initially displayed subsequent [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations during long-term flow and the magnitude of the subsequent oscillations was only 28\% of the initial response.

An 800 N load (1 body weight) was axially applied to the specimens through the tibia with 10\% of the total load distributed through the fibula. Transducers made of pressure-sensitive film were used to make a contact print and were scanned along with calibration strips to form a digital image. The image was analyzed quantitatively to determine total contact area, mean contact pressure, ratio of contact to plafond areas, and high pressure zone centroid location as a function of sagittal plane foot position in the normal ankle joint.

	abstract = {Unreamed nailing favors biology at the expense of the achievable mechanical stability. It is therefore of interest to define the limits of the clinical indications for this method. The extended usage of unreamed tibial nailing resulted in reports of an increased rate of complications, especially for the distal portion of the tibia. The goals of this work were to gain a thorough understanding of the load-sharing mechanism between unreamed nail and bone in a fractured tibia, to identify the mechanical reasons for the unfavorable clinical results, and to identify borderline indications due to biomechanical factors. In a three-dimensional finite element model of a human tibia, horizontal defects were stabilized by means of unreamed nailing for five different fracture locations, including proximal and distal borderline indications for this treatment method. The loading of the bone, the loading of the implant and the inter-fragmentary strains were computed. The findings of this study show that with all muscle and joint contact forces included, nailing leads to considerable unloading of the interlocked bone segments. Unreamed nailing of the distal defect results in an extremely low axial and high shear strain between the fragments. The results suggest that mechanical conditions are advantageous to unreamed nailing of proximal and mid-diaphyseal defects. Apart from biological reasons, clinical problems reported for distal fractures may be due to the less favorable mechanical conditions in unreamed nailing. From a biomechanical perspective, the treatment of distal tibial shaft fractures by means of unreamed nailing without additional fragment contact or without stabilizing the fibula should be carefully reconsidered.},

The constructs were tested for permanent deformation after cyclical loading (amplitude = 242.2N) and elastic deformation during static loading with 490.5N. Radiographs were taken before loading and then after unloading to determine permanent deformation or during loading to determine elastic deformation. We used RSA to quantify the six degrees of freedom interfragmentary maximum total motion, strain, and stress. For maximum total motion the CBP had more permanent deformation and two failures, whereas the LISS underwent the greatest elastic deformation. LISS and CBP had the highest strain conditions in the fracture gap and LISS had the greatest stress movements between fragments, all of which exceeded the upper limits for bone healing. LISS and CBP may not be indicated for comminuted fractures due to the high degree of flexibility of the LISS, resulting in high stress and strain conditions and susceptibility to catastrophic failure and high strain conditions with the CBP.},

	abstract = {In orthopaedic clinical studies, quantitative X-ray bone densitometric analysis could provide precise means of detecting alterations within the bone. With duel-energy X-ray absorptiometry and diphotonic absorptiometry precise and reproducible measures are possible, but they require a specific and costly examination. The use of routine and past available radiographs could facilitate long-term follow-up retrospective studies, but when femoral X-ray bone density is assessed by the naked eye on conventional radiographs, the percentage of errors may be very high (80\%). The advantage of a method using conventional radiographs has led us to look for an original technology to estimate X-ray bone density from routine radiographs using both soft tissues and prostheses as X-ray absorptiometric phantoms. In theory, this calculation requires several approximations. An experimental study based on 40 subjects aimed at determining the rate of error due to these approximations. Three radiographs were made for every subject with very different exposure settings. They were computerized by a CCD camera to measure the grey levels (256 scale) of soft tissue and prosthesis, as well as variations in contrast. The statistical analysis showed that when comparing X-ray bone density on different routine radiographs, the percentage of error could be lower than 10\% but only under these conditions: (a) grey levels of soft tissue {\textgreater} 26; (b) grey levels of prosthesis {\textless} 212; (c) variation of contrast between radiographs {\textgreater} 0.79; (d) radiographs made with the same incidence, and (e) weight of the subject remaining constant during the whole period. It therefore seems possible to compare retrospectively the cortical X-ray bone density from routine radiographs, and to quantify bone remodelling around total hip arthroplasty, but only for the same subject.},

	abstract = {Improvement of joint prostheses is dependent upon information concerning the biomechanical properties of the joint. Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) and electromagnetic techniques have been applied in previous cadaver and in vivo studies on the elbow joint to provide valuable information concerning joint motion axes. However, such information is limited to mathematically calculated positions of the axes according to an orthogonal coordinate system and is difficult to relate to individual skeletal anatomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vivo application of a new fusion method to provide three-dimensional (3D) visualization of flexion axes according to bony landmarks. In vivo RSA data of the elbow joint's flexion axes was combined with data obtained by 3D computed tomography (CT). Results were obtained from five healthy subjects after one was excluded due to an instable RSA marker. The median error between imported and transformed RSA marker coordinates and those obtained in the CT volume was 0.22 mm. Median maximal rotation error after transformation of the rigid RSA body to the CT volume was 0.003 degrees . Points of interception with a plane calculated in the RSA orthogonal coordinate system were imported into the CT volume, facilitating the 3D visualization of the flexion axes. This study demonstrates a successful fusion of RSA and CT data, without significant loss of RSA accuracy. The method could be used for relating individual motion axes to a 3D representation of relevant joint anatomy, thus providing important information for clinical applications such as the development of joint prostheses.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Total hip and total knee arthroplasties are well accepted as reliable and suitable surgical procedures to return patients to function. Health-related quality-of-life instruments have been used to document outcomes in order to optimize the allocation of resources. The objective of this study was to review the literature regarding the outcomes of total hip and knee arthroplasties as evaluated by health-related quality-of-life instruments. METHODS: The Medline and EMBASE medical literature databases were searched, from January 1980 to June 2003, to identify relevant studies. Studies were eligible for review if they met the following criteria: (1). the language was English or French, (2). at least one well-validated and self-reported health-related quality of life instrument was used, and (3). a prospective cohort study design was used. RESULTS: Of the seventy-four studies selected for the review, thirty-two investigated both total hip and total knee arthroplasties, twenty-six focused on total hip arthroplasty, and sixteen focused on total knee arthroplasty exclusively. The most common diagnosis was osteoarthritis. The duration of follow-up ranged from seven days to seven years, with the majority of studies describing results at six to twelve months. The Short Form-36 and the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index, the most frequently used instruments, were employed in forty and twenty-eight studies, respectively. Seventeen studies used a utility index. Overall, total hip and total knee arthroplasties were found to be quite effective in terms of improvement in health-related quality-of-life dimensions, with the occasional exception of the social dimension. Age was not found to be an obstacle to effective surgery, and men seemed to benefit more from the intervention than did women. When improvement was found to be modest, the role of comorbidities was highlighted. Total hip arthroplasty appears to return patients to function to a greater extent than do knee procedures, and primary surgery offers greater improvement than does revision. Patients who had poorer preoperative health-related quality of life were more likely to experience greater improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Health-related quality-of-life data are valuable, can provide relevant health-status information to health professionals, and should be used as a rationale for the implementation of the most adequate standard of care. Additional knowledge and scientific dissemination of surgery outcomes should help to ensure better management of patients undergoing total hip or total knee arthroplasty and to optimize the use of these procedures.},

	abstract = {The viscoelastic and time-dependent plastic effects on the nanoindentation measurement of osteonal lamella in a human cortical bone were investigated. The elastic modulus of osteonal lamella obtained from the quasi-static technique was strongly affected by the indentation rate and time-dependent plasticity. The effects of time-dependent plasticity can be diminished by multiple loading-unloading cycles and a long holding period at maximal load. After minimizing the contribution of time-dependent plasticity to unloading data, it was surprisingly found that the elastic modulus was proportional to indentation strain rate raised to the 0.06 power, which is similar to conventional test results.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of elastic anisotropy on nanoindentation measurements in human tibial cortical bone. Nanoindentation was conducted in 12 different directions in three principal planes for both osteonic and interstitial lamellae. The experimental indentation modulus was found to vary with indentation direction and showed obvious anisotropy (one-way analysis of variance test, P {\textless} 0.0001). Because experimental indentation modulus in a specific direction is determined by all of the elastic constants of cortical bone, a complex theoretical model is required to analyze the experimental results. A recently developed analysis of indentation for the properties of anisotropic materials was used to quantitatively predict indentation modulus by using the stiffness matrix of human tibial cortical bone, which was obtained from previous ultrasound studies. After allowing for the effects of specimen preparation (dehydrated specimens in nanoindentation tests vs. moist specimens in ultrasound tests) and the structural properties of bone (different microcomponents with different mechanical properties), there were no statistically significant differences between the corrected experimental indentation modulus (Mexp) values and corresponding predicted indentation modulus (Mpre) values (two-tailed unpaired t-test, P {\textgreater} 0.5). The variation of Mpre values was found to exhibit the same trends as the corrected Mexp data. These results show that the effects of anisotropy on nanoindentation measurements can be quantitatively evaluated.},

To work in that direction I consider sex/gender differences in bone development. Bone is often considered to be a hard, permanent substance, a reflection of pure biological (sex) difference. Use, diet, and cultural habits, however, shape bones. The biology of bone is as much a result of culture as it is some inchoate pre-existing biology. I challenge feminists to use dynamic systems and life course theories to look at difference, even biological difference, as something that is never finished, but continually and dynamically produced from moment to moment.},

	volume = {22},
	issn = {8756-3282},
	abstract = {The role of bone microdamage (microscopic cracks or microcracks and ultrastructural collagen matrix and bone mineral damage) in diseases such as osteoarthrosis and osteoporosis is poorly understood. Microdamage accumulation in vivo is influenced by age and cyclic loading, therefore, it would be useful if the burden of microdamage in bone could be assessed by noninvasive measures such as the radiological measurement of bone mineral density (BMD). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between BMD, compressive strength and stiffness, and microdamage in the cancellous bone of the proximal femur in patients with severe osteoarthrosis. Trabecular bone core samples, from the intertrochanteric region of the femur, were obtained from 34 patients, with a mean age of 70.3 +/- 11.1 years, undergoing total hip arthroplasty for osteoarthrosis. Cores selected from contact X-ray images were used for BMD measurement, compressive mechanical testing or left untested (uncrushed), en bloc staining for microdamage, and bone histomorphometry. The study shows a strong dependence of both the elastic modulus and ultimate failure stress of the bone samples on BMD and a significant relationship between the elastic modulus and trabecular anisotropy (Tr.An). In multiple linear regression, BMD and Tr.An together account for about 70\% of the variance in the elastic modulus. Then including microcrack crack density (Cr.Dn) and damage volume fraction (DxV/BV) variables, Tr.An alone accounts for a relatively small amount of the variation (8.5\%) in ultimate failure stress and elastic modulus. The Cr.Dn accounts for more of the variation in the ultimate failure stress than in the elastic modulus (50\% vs. 7\%). In this experiment, data for Cr.Dn provide a measure of damage associated with the ultimate failure of cancellous bone. In specimens that were not mechanically tested, in vivo microcrack accumulation increases exponentially with age. In conclusion, data from this study suggest that BMD and Cr.Dn are the major determinants of cancellous bone strength, whereas BMD and Tr.An are major determinants of cancellous bone stiffness. In bone specimens subjected to compressive testing there was no relationship between microdamage and BMD, suggesting that BMD cannot be used to monitor changes in the mechanical properties of bone due to microdamage accumulation.},

The purpose of the current study was to analyze the mechanisms of failure in patients who had revision surgery within 5 years of their index arthroplasty. Between 1986 and 1999, 440 patients with total knee arthroplasties were referred for revision surgery. An analysis of patients in whom the arthroplasties failed within 5 years of the index arthroplasty and the reasons for early failure were documented. Of the 440 patients who had revision surgery, 279 (63\%) had revision surgery within 5 years of their index arthroplasty: 105 of the 279 patients with early failures (38\%) had revision surgery because of infection; 74 (27\%) had revision surgery because of instability; 37 (13\%) had revision surgery because of failure of ingrowth of a porous-coated implant; 22 (8\%) had revision surgery because of patellofemoral problems; and 21 (7\%) had revision surgery because of wear or osteolysis. Only eight of the 279 patients with early failures (3\%) had revision surgery because of aseptic loosening of a cemented implant. The remaining 12 patients had revision surgery because of miscellaneous problems. Host factors may prevent infection from ever being eradicated totally. The two other major patterns of failure in this series were failure of cementless fixation and instability. If all of the arthroplasties in the patients in this early failure group would have been cemented routinely and balanced carefully, the total number of early revisions would have decreased by approximately 40\%, and the overall failures would have been reduced by 25\%.},

	abstract = {Labrum pathology may contribute to early joint degeneration through the alteration of load transfer between, and the stresses within, the cartilage layers of the hip. We hypothesize that the labrum seals the hip joint, creating a hydrostatic fluid pressure in the intra-articular space, and limiting the rate of cartilage layer consolidation. The overall cartilage creep consolidation of six human hip joints was measured during the application of a constant load of 0.75 times bodyweight, or a cyclic sinusoidal load of 0.75+/-0.25 times bodyweight, before and after total labrum resection. The fluid pressure within the acetabular was measured. Following labrum resection, the initial consolidation rate was 22\% greater (p=0.02) and the final consolidation displacement was 21\% greater (p=0.02). There was no significant difference in the final consolidation rate. Loading type (constant vs. cyclic) had no significant effect on the measured consolidation behaviour. Fluid pressurisation was observed in three of the six hips. The average pressures measured were: for constant loading, 541+/-61kPa in the intact joint and 216+/-165kPa following labrum resection, for cyclic loading, 550+/-56kPa in the intact joint and 195+/-145kPa following labrum resection. The trends observed in this experiment support the predictions of previous finite element analyses. Hydrostatic fluid pressurisation within the intra-articular space is greater with the labrum than without, which may enhance joint lubrication. Cartilage consolidation is quicker without the labrum than with, as the labrum adds an extra resistance to the flow path for interstitial fluid expression. However, both sealing mechanisms are dependent on the fit of the labrum against the femoral head.},

In this work, we have developed an analytical parametric microstructural model, which captures this restriction. Using homogenisation theory, a global material model was obtained. An optimal structure constructed of the homogenised material could then be found by optimising a cost function accounting for both the structural stiffness and the biological cost associated with metabolic maintenance of the bone tissue. The formulation was applied to an example problem of the proximal femur. Optimal densities and orientations were obtained for single load cases. The situation of multiple loads was also considered. In this case, we observe that the alignment of principal strains with the material orthotropy direction is, in general, not possible for all load cases. Thus less restrictive microstructures (nonorthotropic) will yield higher structural stiffnesses than strictly orthotropic microstructures.},

	abstract = {A compensation for differences in bone material quality by bone geometric properties in femora from two different strains of rats was previously shown by us. A feedback mechanism controlling the mechanical properties of the integrated bones was then proposed, in accordance with Frost's mechanostat theory. Evidence of such a system is now offered by the finding of a negative correlation between the modeling-dependent cross-sectional architecture (moment of inertia) and the mineral-dependent stiffness (elastic modulus) of bone material in the femoral diaphyses of 45 normal Wistar rats of different sexes, ages, and sizes. The strength and stiffness of the integrated diaphyses were found to depend on both cross-sectional inertia and body weight, not on bone mineral density. These findings are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that the architectural efficiency of diaphyseal cross-sectional design resulting from the spatial orientation of bone modeling during growth is optimized as a function of the body weight-dependent bone strain history, within the constraints imposed by bone stiffness. Results suggest a modulating role of biomass, related to the system set point determination, and explain the usually observed lack of a direct correlation between mineral density and strength or stiffness of long bones in studies of geometrically inhomogeneous populations.},

Low doses had no effect. Medium doses, previously shown to improve calcium (Ca) balance and weight gain in the species, augmented diaphyseal elastic and ultimate strength, stiffness, and plastic-to-elastic deformation ratio with respect to untreated controls. This effect was achieved either by enhancing bone mass (volume, sectional moment of inertia, wall/lumen ration) without changes in material quality parameters (32 mg/kg/day) or, conversely, by increasing bone tissue mechanical properties (stress, modulus of elasticity) not affecting bone geometry (48 and 64 mg/kg/day). The highest dose, known to depress Ca balance and weight gain, impaired diaphyseal mechanical performance in controls by substantially reducing bone mass without major variation in bone material properties, that is, developing a true osteopenic state in mechanical terms. The energy elastically absorbed per unit volume (proportional to the risk of comminute fractures) was greater with the highest dose because of enhanced deformability and diminished bone mass. The biphasic dose-response curves obtained, grossly parallel to those previously demonstrated for metabolic actions of cortisol in the same species, showed that biomechanical repercussion of this treatment on bone depends on different, dose-dependent effects which vary independently in temporal course, intensity, and sign.},

Machined bovine and human cortical bone samples were subjected to loading cycles at a nominal load/unload rate of +/- 420 MPa/s. Loads were reversed at pre selected strain levels such that load cycles were typically completed in 0.5-0.7 seconds. Axial strain behavior demonstrated considerable nonlinearity in the first load cycle, while transverse strain behavior was essentially linear. For the human bone 29.1 percent (S.D. = 4.7 percent), and for the bovine bone 35.1 percent (S.D. = 10.8 percent) of the maximum nonlinear strain accumulated after load reversal, where nonlinear strain was defined as the difference between total strain and strain corresponding to linear elastic behavior. Average residual axial strain on unloading was 35.4 percent (S.D. = 1.2 percent) for human bone and 35.1 percent (S.D. = 2.9 percent) of maximum nonlinear strain. Corresponding significant volumetric strains and residual volumetric strains were found. The results support the conclusions that the nonlinear stress-strain behavior observed during creep loading also occurs during transient loading at physiological rates. The volume increases suggest that damage accumulation, i.e., new internal surfaces and voids, plays a major role in this behavior. The residual volume increases and associated disruptions in the internal structure of bone provide a potential stimulus for a biological repair response.},

One ISV is a damage parameter that represents the loss of stiffness. A rule for the evolution of this ISV was defined based on previously observed creep behavior. The second ISV represents the inelastic strain due to viscosity and internal friction. The model was tested by simulating experiments in tensile and bending loading. Using average values from previous creep studies for parameters in the damage evolution rule, the model tended to underestimate the maximum nonlinear strains and to overestimate the nonlinear strain accumulated after load reversal in the tensile test simulations. Varying the parameters for the individual tests produced excellent fits to the experimental data. Similarly, the model simulations of the bending tests could produce excellent fits to the experimental data. The results demonstrate that the 2-ISV model combining damage (stiffness loss) with slip and viscous behavior could capture the nonlinear tensile behavior of cortical bone in axial and bending loading.},

	abstract = {Basic multicellular unit (BMU)-based remodeling of lamellar bone causes bone turnover, net gains and losses of bone on some bone surfaces or "envelopes," and a remodeling space comprising bone temporarily absent due to evolving resorption spaces and incomplete refilling of them by new bone. Those features depend a) on how many new BMU arise annually, b) on how much bone each BMU has resorbed and c) formed upon its completion, and d) on how long the typical BMU takes to become completed. Because a, b, and c have limiting or maximal values in life that direct and/or indirect effects of mechanical usage of the skeleton can change, the theory presented here derives mechanical usage functions that express what fractions of those maxima a given mechanical usage history allows to happen. The theory predicts some changes in bone formation, resorption, balance, turnover, and remodeling space that depend on how remodeling responds to the vigor of a subject's mechanical usage. The theory can predict specific effects of specific mechanical challenges that experiments can test, and it fits abundant published evidence. As the kernel of a new approach to the problem it awaits critique and refinement by others. It plus the 3-way rule can redefine Wolff's law conceptually and also in mathematical and quantifiable form.},

The mechanisms of failure were examined microscopically and histologically. The primary mechanism of failure was shown to be microscopic cracking rather than overt failure of the trabecular elements. The morphology of the cracks was consistent with an hypothesis that they were the result of shear stress (or strain) in the tissue. Complete fracture of trabeculae was confined to elements oriented transversely to the direction of loading. The tissue's ultimate strength and residual strength after compressive failure were both strongly correlated to tissue stiffness (R2 = 0.88 and R2 = 0.71, respectively). It is proposed that cancellous bone strength may be a consequence of the adaptation of bone stiffness to applied stresses. With removal of the load, all specimens recovered at least 94\% of their original height. Implications of energy dissipation by microcracking for recovery and maintenance of overall trabecular architecture are discussed.},

Using finite element analysis, (ANSYS), the stresses were determined as a function of the amount of bone resection, the localization or completeness of implant-bone contact, and the interface material. The model was of two-dimensional sagittal slices consisting of quadrilateral elements (1 mm) with a range of seventeen material properties determined by CT scans. Typical prosthesis designs shifted the center of pressure more centrally rather than posteriorly, and thus increased anterior bone stresses. Resection up to 10 mm could actually decrease bone stresses due to an increase in bone surface area as long as complete coverage was obtained. A cement interface or direct metal on bone produced identical stresses. However a 1 mm compliant interface significantly reduced stresses in regions of high elastic modulus gradient. For rigid interfaces, the contact can be irregular, which leads to areas of over and under-stressing of bone. These conclusions have implications related to implant design.},

Twenty-four spinal cord injured patients underwent QDR of the left knee. Seven of the 24 were selected, each of whom had bone mineral loss from 10-70\% in 10\% increments as assessed by comparison to average BMD of age-matched controls, and a standardized AP radiograph of the left knee was performed. Twenty-five independent examiners (orthopaedic surgeons and residents) were then asked to view the randomly arranged radiographs and visually determine the amount of BMD loss for each radiograph as compared to a control radiograph at 100\%. Chi square analysis of the data revealed that the distribution of responses was significantly different than expected at the p less than .01 level. Taking into account that responses may have erred by +/-10\%, the distribution of responses was again found to be significant at the p less than .01 level. An accurate determination of BMD loss was achieved only at 10\% bone loss and 70\% bone loss. The results of this study suggest that the visual determination of bone loss based on plain radiographs is accurate only at very low or very high levels of bone loss. Using standardized techniques, only near normal radiographs or radiographs with at least 70\% BMD loss can be assessed accurately.},

Two series of tests were done for different longitudinal and transverse specimens from a human tibia. Wet bone exhibited a larger viscoelastic damping tan delta (phase between stress and strain sinusoids) than dry bone over a broad range of frequency. All the results had in common a relative minimum in tan delta over a frequency range, 1 to 100 Hz, which is predominantly contained in normal activities. This behavior is inconsistent with an optimal "design" for bone as a shock absorber. There was no definitive damping peak in the range of frequencies explored, which could be attributed to fluid flow in the porosity of bone.},

After testing, the cubes were weighed and ashed to determine the apparent and ash densities. A high correlation between the basic stereologic measurements was found, indicating that there is a relationship between the amount of bone and number of trabeculae in cancellous bone. Regression analysis was used to estimate the modulus and ultimate strength; these regressions accounted for 68-90\% of the variance in these measures. These relationships were dependent on the metaphyseal type and donor, with the modulus also dependent on the direction of testing.

	abstract = {The problem of quantifying the structure of cancellous bone has been addressed in the past by histomorphometry and more recently by imaging techniques using X-ray attenuation. The current approaches compute and describe parts of the construction of the trabecular net. We developed a new technique which quantifies cancellous bone of human lumbar vertebrae as a whole. The interactions, transactions, and interrelationships of all parts of the structural composition of the trabeculae are accounted for and quantified. The method is based on the concept of structural complexity within the framework of nonlinear dynamics. The methodology was developed by using axial high resolution computed tomography images. The technique was transferred to quantitative computed tomography images and is based on the non-invasive assessment of 50 human L3 specimens. The value of Houndsfield units per pixel representing trabecular bone of the vertebrae was transformed into color-encoded and alphabet-encoded symbols. The procedure of transformation of the X-ray attenuation pixels into symbols was necessary as a basis on which measures of complexity were introduced to assess the composition of symbols within the images. The development of a generalization of symbolic dynamics, a mathematical method, to work with two-dimensional images was a prerequisite. The results of this study demonstrate that the structural composition of cancellous bone declines more rapidly than bone mineral density during the loss of bone. This outcome strongly suggests an exponential relationship between bone mineral density and the architectural composition of cancellous bone. Normal trabecular bone has a complex ordered structure. The structural composition during the osteopenic phase of bone loss is characterized by lower structural complexity and a significantly higher level of architectural disorder. A high grade of osteoporosis leads again to an ordered structure, although its structural complexity is minimal.},

Trabecular and total BMD were measured with peripheral quantitative computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: In healthy women, 1/T2* values and trabecular BMD at peripheral quantitative CT were significantly correlated but 1/T2* and total BMD were not. Statistically significant (P = .03) correlations between 1/T2* and DXA were found only in the most distal area covered with DXA. The 1/T2* values were more closely correlated with age and showed higher relative annual decreases (0.47\%-0.81\%) than peripheral quantitative CT (0.20\%-0.59\%) or DXA (0.10\%-0.39\%). Pre- and postmenopausal healthy subjects could be distinguished only with MR imaging, and postmenopausal healthy and osteoporotic subjects only with CT and DXA.

	abstract = {The major cause of orthopaedic implant loosening is thought to be accelerated osteoclastic bone resorption due to the action of cytokines produced in response to phagocytosis of implant-derived wear particles. This accelerated osteoclastic bone resorption could be due to increases in any of the following processes: recruitment of osteoclast precursors to the local microenvironment, differentiation of precursors into mature multinucleated osteoclasts. activation of mature osteoclasts, and/or survival of osteoclasts. Our studies have focused on differentiation and survival to complement work by others who have focused on recruitment of precursors and activation. Taken together, our studies and those of other investigators provide strong evidence that increased recruitment of osteoclast precursors and their subsequent differentiation play major roles in wear particle-induced osteolysis. In contrast, increased osteoclast activation and survival appear to play minor roles. These studies suggest that development of therapeutic interventions that reduce either recruitment or differentiation of osteoclast precursors would improve the performance of orthopaedic implants.

Fresh bovine cancellous specimens of dimensions 10 x 10 x 10 mm3 and 10 x 40 x 3.6 mm3 were manufactured and used within the testing programme. Results published in the literature indicate that the long-term behaviour of cancellous bone is well described by a power law, which is a very similar response of typical polymers. So far, dynamic mechanical tests (DMA) in three-point bending, under frequencies between 0.01 and 100 Hz at room temperature, confirmed the published results in a qualitative way. Nevertheless, the measured dimensionless damping, tan delta, was slightly higher than the values reported in the literature for the compact bone. The relaxation curves were obtained from dynamic tests and confirmed that bone relaxation modulus can be described by a power law function of time. Tests under constant compression strain rate were performed at four different strain rates: 0.15/s, 0.015/s, 0.0015/s and 0.00015/s and strain rate dependent behaviour was observed. An average elastic bending modulus of 300 MPa was obtained.},

	abstract = {A hydraulically activated bone chamber model was utilized to investigate cellular and microstructural mechanisms of mechanical adaptation during bone repair. Woven trabecular bone and fibrotic granulation tissue filled the initially empty chambers by 8 weeks postimplantation into canine tibial and femoral metaphyses. Without mechanical stimulation, active bone remodeling to lamellar trabecular bone and reconstitution of marrow elements were observed between 8 and 24 weeks. In subsequent loading studies, the hydraulic mechanism was activated on one randomly chosen side of 10 dogs following 8 weeks of undisturbed bone repair. The loading treatment applied an intermittent compressive force (18 N, 1.0 Hz, 1800 cycles/day) for durations of a few days up to 12 weeks. Stereological analysis of three-dimensional microcomputed tomography images revealed an increase in trabecular plate thickness and connectivity associated with the loaded repair tissue microstructure relative to unloaded contralateral controls. These microstructural alterations corresponded to an over 600\% increase in the apparent modulus of the loaded bone tissue. A significant increase in the percentage of trabecular surfaces lined by osteoblasts immunopositive for type I procollagen after a few days of loading provided further evidence for mechanical stimulation of bone matrix synthesis. The local principal tissue strains associated with these adaptive changes were estimated to range from approximately -2000 to +3000 mustrain using digital image-based finite element methods. This study demonstrates the sensitivity of bone tissue and cells to a controlled in vivo mechanical stimulus and identifies microstructural mechanisms of mechanical adaptation during bone repair. The hydraulic bone chamber is introduced as an efficient experimental model to study the effects of mechanical and biological factors on bone repair and regeneration.},

	abstract = {Digital image-based finite element meshing is an alternative approach to time-consuming conventional meshing techniques for generating realistic three-dimensional (3D) models of complex structures. Although not limited to biological applications, digital image-based modeling has been used to generate structure-specific (i.e., non-generic) models of whole bones and trabecular bone microstructures. However, questions remain regarding the solution accuracy provided by the digital meshing approach, particularly at model or material boundaries. The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of digital and conventional smooth boundary models based on theoretical solutions for a two-dimensional (2D) compression plate and a 3D circular cantilever beam. For both the plate and beam analyses, the predicted solution at digital model boundaries was characterized by local oscillations, which produced potentially high errors within individual boundary elements. Significantly, however, the digital model boundary solution oscillated approximately about the theoretical solution. A marked improvement in solution accuracy was therefore achieved by considering average results within a region composed of several elements. Absolute errors for Von Mises stress averaged over the beam cross section, for example, converged to less than 4 percent, and the predicted free-end displacement of the cantilever beam was within 1 percent of the theoretical solution. Analyses at several beam orientations and mesh resolutions suggested a minimum discretization of three to four digital finite elements through the beam cross section to avoid high numerical stiffening errors under bending.},

	title = {Development and experimental validation of a three-dimensional finite element model of the human scapula},
	volume = {218},
	abstract = {A new modelling approach, using a combination of shell and solid elements, has been adopted to develop a realistic three-dimensional finite element (FE) model of the human scapula. Shell elements were used to represent a part of the compact bone layer (i.e. the outer cortical layer) and the very thin and rather flat part of the scapula–infraspinous fossa and supraspinous fossa respectively. Solid elements were used to model the remaining part of the compact bone and the trabecular bone. The FE model results in proper element shapes without distortion. The geometry, material properties and thickness were taken from quantitative computed tomography (CT) data. A thorough experimental set-up for strain gauge measurement on a fresh bone serves as a reference to assess the accuracy of FE predictions. A fresh cadaveric scapula with 18 strain gauges fixed at various locations and orientations was loaded in a mechanical testing machine and supported at three locations by linkage mechanisms interconnected by ball joints. This new experimental set-up was developed to impose bending and deflection of the scapula in all directions unambiguously, in response to applied loads at various locations. The measured strains (experimental) were compared to numerical (FE) strains, corresponding to several load cases, to validate the proposed FE modelling approach. Linear regression analysis was used to assess the accuracy of the results. The percentage error in the regression slope varies between 9 and 23 per cent. It appears, as a whole, that the two variables (measured and calculated strains) strongly depend on each other with a confidence level of more than 95 per cent. Considering the complicated testing procedure on a fresh sample of scapula, the high correlation coefficients (0.89-0.97), the low standard errors (29-105 micro epsilon) and percentage errors in the regression slope, as compared to other studies, strongly suggest that the strains calculated by the FE model can be used as a valid predictor of the actual measured strain. The model is therefore an alternative to a rigorous three-dimensional model based on solid elements only, which might often be too expensive in terms of computing time.},

Investigators are therefore faced with the challenge of constructing an index for a specific condition or even for a single trial. There are several stages in the development and testing of a quality-of-life measure: selecting an initial item pool, choosing the "best" items from that pool, deciding on questionnaire format, pretesting the instrument, and demonstrating the responsiveness and validity of the instrument. At each stage the investigator must choose between a rigorous, time-consuming approach to questionnaire construction that will establish the clinical relevance, responsiveness and validity of the instrument and a more efficient, less costly strategy that leaves reproducibility, responsiveness and validity untested. This article describes these options and outlines a pragmatic approach that yields consistently satisfactory disease-specific measures of quality of life.},

Only patients who had had revision of the femoral component or the tibial component, or both, because of aseptic failure were included. The tibial component of all prostheses that were used for revision had a metal backing. Cement was placed on the cut surfaces in the metaphyseal region of the femur and tibia. Fluted diaphyseal intramedullary rods were used in all patients and were not cemented. Metal wedges and augments were used to fill osseous defects when necessary. The average preoperative knee score, according to the rating scale of The Hospital for Special Surgery, was 49 points (range, 0 to 62 points). Postoperatively, the knee score improved to an average of 76 points (range, 0 to 97 points). Of the sixty-seven knees that had complete follow-up, fifty-six (84 percent) had an excellent or good result and five (7 percent) had a fair or poor result. In six (8 percent) of the seventy-six knees, the prosthesis failed, necessitating another revision. Failure was defined as removal or a recommendation for removal of the implant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Efficient computer models present an effective way of evaluating these characteristics. Predicted contact stress and area due to articulations at the tibio-femoral and patello-femoral interfaces indicate potential clinical performance. Previous finite element (FE) knee models have generally been used to predict contact stresses and/or areas during static or quasi-static loading conditions. Explicit dynamic FE analyses have recently been used to efficiently predict TKR kinematics and contact mechanics during dynamic loading conditions. The objective of this study was to develop and experimentally validate an explicit FE TKR model that incorporates tibio-femoral and patello-femoral articulations. For computational efficiency, we developed rigid body analyses that can reasonably reproduce the kinematics, contact pressure distribution, and contact area of a fully deformable system. Results from the deformable model showed that the patello-femoral and tibio-femoral kinematics were in good agreement with experimental knee simulator measurements. Kinematic results from the rigid body analyses were nearly identical to those from the fully deformable model, and the contact pressure and contact area correlation was acceptable given the great reduction in analysis time. Component mesh density studied had little effect on the predicted kinematics, particularly for the patellar component, and small effects on the predicted contact pressure and area. These analyses have shown that, at low computational cost, a force-control dynamic simulation of a gait cycle can yield useful and predictable results.},

	abstract = {Thrombospondin 3 (TSP3) is structurally similar to cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP/TSP5), but its function is unknown. To determine the functional significance of TSP3, we generated mice with a targeted disruption of Thbs3. TSP3-null mice are viable and fertile and show normal prenatal skeletal patterning, based on Alcian blue/Alizarin red S staining. However, subtle and transient abnormalities were detected in the developing postnatal skeleton. Young adult TSP3-null mice are heavier than controls, and analyses of the geometric and biomechanical properties of long bones show increases in the moments of inertia, endocortical and periostal radii, and failure load. The bones of 9-week-old TSP3-null male mice also have a significantly greater cortical area. Most of these differences were no longer detected in 15-week-old mice. Micro-computed tomography scans showed that the trabecular bone proximal to the femoral head growth plate developed at an earlier time in TSP3-null mice than in wild-type mice. Thus, vascular invasion and ossification start in the femoral heads of TSP3-null mice at 9 weeks, whereas the wild-type femoral head is still composed of hypertrophic chondroctyes in a calcified matrix at 15 weeks. These results provide evidence for a role for TSP3 in the regulation of skeletal maturation in mice.},

The mathematical model of the heat transfer was based on first principles from polymerization kinetics and heat transfer, rather than certain in vitro observed properties, which has been the common approach. Our model was valid for general three-dimensional geometries and an arbitrary bone cement consisting of an initiator and monomer. The model was simulated for a cross-section of a hip with a potential femoral stem prosthesis and for a cement similar to Palacos R. The simulations were conducted by using the finite element method. These simulations showed that this general model described an auto accelerating heat production and a residual monomer concentration, which are two phenomena suggested to cause bone tissue damage and effect the mechanical properties of the cement.},

These limitations are explored using a probabilistic line scanning model for density measurement, resulting in an estimate of density accuracy as a function of line length which is experimentally verified. Within three to five trabeculae of an interface, a continuum model is suspect. When results as predicted using continuum analyses vary by more than 20-30\% over a distance spanning three to five trabeculae, the results are suspect.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Conventional knee and hip implant systems have been in use for many years with good success. However, the custom design of implant components based on patient-specific anatomy has been attempted to overcome existing shortcomings of current designs. The longevity of cementless implant components is highly dependent on the initial fit between the bone surface and the implant. The bone-implant interface design has historically been limited by the surgical tools and cutting guides available; and the cost of fabricating custom-designed implant components has been prohibitive. METHODS: This paper describes an approach where the custom design is based on a Computed Tomography scan of the patient's joint. The proposed design will customize both the articulating surface and the bone-implant interface to address the most common problems found with conventional knee-implant components. Finite Element Analysis is used to evaluate and compare the proposed design of a custom femoral component with a conventional design. RESULTS: The proposed design shows a more even stress distribution on the bone-implant interface surface, which will reduce the uneven bone remodeling that can lead to premature loosening. CONCLUSION: The proposed custom femoral component design has the following advantages compared with a conventional femoral component. (i) Since the articulating surface closely mimics the shape of the distal femur, there is no need for resurfacing of the patella or gait change. (ii) Owing to the resulting stress distribution, bone remodeling is even and the risk of premature loosening might be reduced. (iii) Because the bone-implant interface can accommodate anatomical abnormalities at the distal femur, the need for surgical interventions and fitting of filler components is reduced. (iv) Given that the bone-implant interface is customized, about 40\% less bone must be removed. The primary disadvantages are the time and cost required for the design and the possible need for a surgical robot to perform the bone resection. Some of these disadvantages may be eliminated by the use of rapid prototyping technologies, especially the use of Electron Beam Melting technology for quick and economical fabrication of custom implant components.},

Of the 16 knees that were revision total knee arthroplasties, 8 had a previous infected total knee arthroplasty, and 17 knees had severe deformities requiring the use of the condylar constrained prosthesis. The patients were rated according to the Knee Society clinical and radiological evaluation protocol. Measurements of femoral and tibial component position were obtained as well as femoral tibial angle, patella position, and cement bone radiolucencies. All clinical measurements were made by an independent physical therapist. Clinical results revealed an improvement from an average preoperative knee score of 38 points to an average postoperative score of 86 points. The clinical results for 19 (58\%) knees were excellent, 8 (24\%) had a good result, 1 (3\%) was fair, 2 (6\%) were poor, and 3 (9\%) were failures. The patients' average functional levels increased from 24 to 58. The final average flexion was 96 degrees. Three knees have been revised (9\%). One was revised for recurrent infection, one for periprosthetic fracture, and one for mechanical loosening of the tibial component. There were no other knees with evidence of radiologic loosening. We conclude that the condylar constrained total knee prosthesis provides an acceptable solution for revision and complex primary total knee replacements at an intermediate follow-up term of 5 years.},

	abstract = {Bidirectional friction tests between cancellous bone cubes and a porous-coated metal plate were performed to determine the mechanical properties of the interface required in 3-dimensional (3-D) finite element model studies of cementless implants. Bone specimens were obtained from different proximal regions of four resurfaced cadaveric tibiae. A beaded porous-surfaced plate similar to those used in implants was used. Tangential loads in perpendicular directions with different magnitudes were applied at the interface in the presence of constant normal pressure, and the displacements were monitored in the same directions. Measured results showed that the interface load-displacement curve is highly nonlinear with significant coupling between two perpendicular directions. The interface friction coefficient (defined as the ratio of the maximum resultant tangential force divided by the normal load) was found to remain nearly unchanged with the relative magnitude of tangential stresses and the bone location. Moreover, bidirectional tests suggested that the load-displacement relation when evaluated for resultant values is similar to that obtained in a unidirectional testing condition. Constitutive equations that account for the cross-stiffness coupling terms between perpendicular directions were also developed.

The influence of the coupling terms on results was investigated by comparison of predictions with measurement results.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare the structural properties of a new vs. established design of composite replicate femurs and tibias. The new design has a cortical bone analog consisting of short-glass-fiber-reinforced (SGFR) epoxy, rather than the fiberglass-fabric-reinforced (FFR) epoxy in the currently available design. The hypothesis was that this new cortical bone analog would improve the uniformity of structural properties between specimens, while having mean stiffness values in the range of natural human bones. The composite replicate bones were tested under bending, axial, and torsional loads. In general, the new SGFR bones were significantly less stiff than the FFR bones, although both bone designs reasonably approximated the structural stiffnesses of natural human bones. With the exceptions of the FFR bone axial tests, the highest variability between specimens was 6.1\%. The new SGFR bones had similar variability in structural properties when compared to the FFR bones under bending and torsional loading, but had significantly less variability under axial loading. Differences in epiphyseal geometry between the FFR and SGFR bones, and subsequent seating in the testing fixtures, may account for some of the differences in structural properties; axial stiffness was especially dependent on bone alignment. Stiffness variabilities for the composite replicate bones were much smaller than those seen with natural human bones. Axial strain distribution along the proximal-medial SGFR femur had a similar shape to what was observed on natural human femurs by other investigators, but was considerably less stiff in the more proximal locations.},

Uncemented hemispherical acetabular cups with titanium mesh pads comprising approximately 26\% of the surface of the cup were inserted in eight adult canine hemipelves ex vivo. The acetabular prostheses were fixed with 13 mm titanium screws. Zero, one, and two-screw configurations were tested, with the order of testing randomly assigned. A load simulating 1,000 cycles of canine gait as applied to the acetabular component, and relative displacements were measured at three locations between implant and bone to determine acute fixation. A repeated measures analysis of variance showed that two screws produced only 42\% of the average relative displacement of one screw and 14\% that of zero screws. Eight adult mixed-breed dogs then underwent unilateral total hip arthroplasty. All acetabula were biologically fixed with two cancellous screws. The results at 4 months showed significantly less relative displacement between the implant and bone than was measured in ex vivo implantations (p = 0.014). Bone ingrowth filled 20 +/- 6\% (mean +/- SD) of the available space. The relative displacements of these implants were small in all cases (12 +/- 13 microns) and did not correlate with the amount of bone ingrowth. These data suggest that acetabular fixation with two screws can lead to bone ingrowth and reduced relative motion of the prosthesis under functional loading.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: High tibial osteotomies attempt to recreate physiologically normal joint loading. Previous studies have discussed the influence of mal-alignment on the distribution of static loads to the medial and lateral compartments of the knee. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of mal-alignment on the tibio-femoral loading conditions during dynamic activities. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using a musculo-skeletal model of the lower limb, which had been previously validated with in vivo data, in this study we modified the alignment of the knee in four patients, from a normal position to the extremes of 8 degrees valgus and 10 degrees varus mal-alignment. The resulting tibio-femoral joint contact forces were examined while patients were walking and stair climbing. RESULTS: Varying the mal-alignment resulted in a highly individual response in joint loads. Deviations from the normal alignment produced an increase in loading, with valgus generating a more rapid increase in loading than a varus deformity of the same amount. Varus deformities of 10 degrees resulted in increases in peak contact force from an average of 3.3-times bodyweight (BW) up to a peak of 7.4 BW (+45\% to +114\%) while patients were walking, whilst increases of 15\% up to 35\% were determined for stair climbing. Increases of up to 140\% were calculated at 8 degrees valgus during walking and up to 53\% for stair climbing. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a clear dependence of the individual joint loads on axial knee alignment. Based on the sensitivity of joint loading to valgus mal-alignment, more than 3 degrees of over-correction of a varus deformity to valgus should be carefully reconsidered.},

	title = {In vivo measurement of bending stiffness in fracture healing},
	volume = {2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Measurement of the bending stiffness a healing fracture represents a valid variable in the assessment of fracture healing. However, currently available methods typically have high measurement errors, even for mild pin loosening. Furthermore, these methods cannot provide actual values of bending stiffness, which precludes comparisons among individual fractures. Thus, even today, little information is available with regards to the fracture healing pattern with respect to actual values of bending stiffness. Our goals were, therefore: to develop a measurement device that would allow accurate and sensitive measurement of bending stiffness, even in the presence of mild pin loosening; to describe the course of healing in individual fractures; and help to evaluate whether the individual pattern of bending stiffness can be predicted at an early stage of healing. METHODS: A new measurement device has been developed to precisely measure the bending stiffness of the healing fracture by simulating four-point-bending. The system was calibrated on aluminum models and intact tibiae. The influence of pin loosening on measurement error was evaluated. The system was tested at weekly intervals in an animal experiment to determine the actual bending stiffness of the fracture. Transverse fractures were created in the right tibia of twelve sheep, and then stabilized with an external fixator. At ten weeks, bending stiffness of the tibiae were determined in a four-point-bending test device to validate the in-vivo-measurement data. RESULTS: In-vivo bending stiffness can be measured accurately and sensitive, even in the early phase of callus healing. Up to a bending stiffness of 10 Nm/degree, measurement error was below 3.4\% for one pin loose, and below 29.3\% for four pins loose, respectively. Measurement of stiffness data over time revealed a significant logarithmic increase between the third and seventh weeks, whereby the logarithmic rate of change among sheep was similar, but started from different levels. Comparative measurements showed that early individual changes between the third and fourth weeks can be used as a predictor of bending stiffness at seven weeks (r = 0.928) and at ten weeks (r = 0.710). CONCLUSION: Bending stiffness can be measured precisely, with less error in the case of pin loosening. Prediction of the future healing course of the individual fracture can be assessed by changes from the third to the fourth week, with differences in stiffness levels. Therefore, the initial status of the fracture seems to have a high impact on the individual healing course.},

More attention must be paid to more accurate implantation techniques that result in a well-balanced ligament and allow the ligaments to act together with the replaced surfaces in a most physiologic manner. To improve the stability of the bone-implant interface over time, specific efforts should be made to better understand the extrinsic and intrinsic forces of the ankle joint, including the forces that are created by the prosthesis itself.},

The results showed that differences exist between subjects significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) and that the mechanical properties vary along the length and the periphery (about a factor 3 to 5). Cancellous bone should be considered heterogeneous and as orthotropic materials exhibiting degrees of anisotropy varying from 2 to 4.

Organ dose equivalents are computed for all radiosensitive organs listed in NCRP Report 116 using the BRYNTRN and HZETRN space radiation transport codes and the Computerized Anatomical Man (CAM) model. These organ dose equivalents are then weighted with the appropriate tissue weighting factors to obtain effective doses. Various thicknesses of aluminum shielding, which are representative of nominal spacecraft and SPE storm shelter configurations, are used in the analyses. For all SPE configurations, the average bone marrow dose equivalent is considerably less than the calculated effective dose. For comparisons of the GCR, there is less than a ten percent difference between the two methods. In all cases, the gonads made up the largest percentage of the effective dose.},

The elastic stiffness coefficients were determined experimentally from ultrasonic velocity measurements on 96 samples of normal cortical bone removed from the right tibia of eight human cadavers. The following measured values were used for our analysis: c11 = 19.5 GPa, c22 = 20.1 GPa, c33 = 30.9 GPa, c44 = 5.72 GPa, c55 = 5.17 GPa, c66 = 4.05 GPa, c23 = 12.5 GPa.

Our analysis revealed a substantial anisotropy in Young's modulus in the plane containing the long axis of the tibia, with maxima of 20.9 GPa parallel to the long axis, and minima of 11.8 GPa perpendicular to this axis. A less pronounced anisotropy was observed in the plane perpendicular to the long axis of the tibia.

But, as it is unlikely that the architecture is fully pre-programmed in the genes, how are the bone cells informed about these rules, which so obviously dictate architecture? A relationship exists between bone architecture and mechanical usage–while strenuous exercise increases bone mass, disuse, as in microgravity and inactivity, reduces it. Bone resorption cells (osteoclasts) and bone formation cells (osteoblasts) normally balance bone mass in a coupled homeostatic process of remodelling, which renews some 25\% of trabecular bone volume per year. Here we present a computational model of the metabolic process in bone that confirms that cell coupling is governed by feedback from mechanical load transfer.

In this project we studied the hypothesis that distortional strain and interstitial fluid flow are the mechanical stimuli governing tissue differentiation. For that purpose, a biomechanical regulatory model was developed and used in association with a finite element code to simulate animal experiments with implants moving in bone. The similarities between the implant incorporation process found in the experiment and its simulation with the computer model demonstrate that our hypothesis is viable from a regulatory point of view.},

	abstract = {Bone resorption around hip stems is a disturbing phenomenon, although its clinical significance and its eventual effects on replacement longevity are as yet uncertain. The relationship between implant flexibility and the extent of bone loss, frequently established in clinical patient series and animal experiments, does suggest that the changes in bone morphology are an effect of stress shielding and a subsequent adaptive remodeling process. This relationship was investigated using strain-adaptive bone-remodeling theory in combination with finite element models to simulate the bone remodeling process. The effects of stem material flexibility, bone flexibility, and bone reactivity on the process and its eventual outcome were studied. Stem flexibility was also related to proximal implant/bone interface stresses. The results sustain the hypothesis that the resorptive processes are an effect of bone adaptation to stress shielding. The effects of stem flexibility are confirmed by the simulation analysis. It was also established that individual differences in bone reactivity and mechanical bone quality (density and stiffness) may account for the individual variations found in patients and animal experiments. Flexible stems reduce stress shielding and bone resorption. However, they increase proximal interface stresses. Hence, the cure against bone resorption they represent may develop into increased loosening rates because of interface debonding and micromotion. The methods presented in this paper can be used to establish optimal stem-design characteristics or check the adequacy of designs in preclinical testing procedures.},

	abstract = {This study tested the validity of the prediction of dynamic knee loads based on gait measurements. The relationship between the predicted loads at the knee and the distribution of bone between the medial and lateral sides of the tibia was examined. The motion and external forces and moments at the knee were measured during gait and a statically determinate muscle model was used to predict the corresponding forces on the medial and lateral tibial plateaus. In particular, the relationship between the knee adduction moment during gait and the ratio or distribution of medial to lateral tibial bone mineral content was studied. Bone mineral content was measured with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry in four regions, two proximal regions 20 mm in height, one medial and one lateral and two distal regions 20 mm in height, one medial and one lateral. The best single predictor of the medial lateral ratio of proximal bone mineral content (bone distribution) was the adduction moment (R2=0.31, p=0.003). Adding weight (negative coefficient. p=0.0004) and the ratio of the average predicted peak force on the medial plateau to the predicted peak force on the lateral plateau (positive coefficient, p=0.0033) to the regression model significantly increased the ability to predict the proximal medial lateral bone distribution (R2=0.72, p=0.0001). Distally neither the subject characteristics nor the gait moments and predicted forces were significant predictors of the bone distribution. The lack of a correlation distally may be reflective of the forces being more evenly distributed further from the tibial plateau. While it has long been suggested that the adduction moment is the primary determinate of the distribution of load between the medial and lateral plateaus, this is the first evidence of its relationship to the underlying bone distribution.},

Specimen X-ray quantitative computed tomography (QCT) obtained at different scanning energies (100, 120 and 140 kVp) yielded closely related results (r = 1.00). Accordingly, predictions of physically measured densities or mechanical properties were not improved by using more than one scanning energy. QCT and physically measured densities were intimately related (QCT at 140 kVp to apparent density using linear regression: r = 0.94, and to apparent ash density: r = 0.95) and did not differ significantly in their ability to predict the mechanical properties, thus favouring the more easily implemented QCT for routine work. Evaluation of the relation of apparent density to Young's modulus and ultimate strength suggested that a power law regression model is preferable to a linear model, although linear model prediction of mechanical properties does not have significantly worse accuracy within the narrow density range investigated. The effect of conditioning on the behaviour of bone specimens subjected to destructive compression tests was to increase the stiffness and strength by approximately 50 and 20\% respectively.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: After total knee arthroplasty (TKA), hospitalization may be shortened by allowing patients to return home with a continuous femoral nerve block (CFNB). This study quantified the hospitalization costs for 10 TKA patients receiving ambulatory CFNB versus a matched cohort of 10 patients who received CFNB only during hospitalization. METHODS: We examined the medical records (n = 125) of patients who underwent a unilateral, primary, tricompartment TKA with a postoperative CFNB by 1 surgeon at one institution in an 18-month period beginning January 2004. Each of the 10 patients discharged home with an ambulatory CFNB (cases) was matched with a patient with a hospital-only CFNB (controls) for age, gender, body mass index, and health status. Financial data were extracted from the hospital microcosting database. RESULTS: Nine patients with ambulatory CFNB (cases) were discharged home on postoperative day (POD) 1 and 1 on POD 4. Of the controls, 3 were discharged home on POD 3, 6 on POD 4, and 1 on POD 5. The median (range) costs of hospitalization (excluding implant and professional fees) was US dollars 5,292 (US dollars 4,326-US dollars 7,929) for ambulatory cases compared with US dollars 7,974 (US dollars 6,931-US dollars 9,979) for inpatient controls (difference = US dollars 2,682, 34\% decrease, P {\textless} .001). The total charges for hospitalization, the implant, and professional fees was US dollars 33,646 (US dollars 31,816-US dollars 38,468) for cases compared with US dollars 39,100 (US dollars 36,096-US dollars 44,098) for controls (difference = US dollars 5,454, 14\% decrease, P {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that ambulatory CFNB for selected patients undergoing TKA has the potential to reduce hospital length of stay and associated costs and charges. However, the current study has significant inherent limitations based on the study design. Additional research is required to replicate these results in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial and to determine whether any savings exceed additional CFNB costs such as from complications, having caregivers provide care at home, and additional hospital/health care provider visits.},

	abstract = {We studied the first 100 consecutive patients (125 knees) to undergo knee arthroplasty with the original total condylar-I prosthesis for either osteoarthritis or osteonecrosis on the Knee Service at The Hospital for Special Surgery. They were followed for an average of 6.6 years (range, five to nine years), which is the longest follow-up of a total knee prosthesis that is still widely used in its original and unmodified form. At five to nine years of follow-up, eleven patients (fourteen knees) were dead and ten patients (eleven knees) could not be traced, leaving 100 knees (seventy-nine patients) for clinical evaluation. This included one knee from which the prosthesis was removed for sepsis at six months, four that were revised for pain, and two that were revised because of subluxation. Two patients had a loose tibial component. Sixty-four knees were rated as excellent and twenty-seven were rated as good. There were two fair and seven poor results. Detailed radiographic evaluation of the 100 knees showed that only minimum changes in the varus or valgus alignment or the fixation of the prosthetic components had occurred with time. At follow-up, 41 per cent of the tibial components showed some evidence of radiolucency, although with the exception of the two loose components just mentioned there were no complete or circumferential radiolucent lines. Most radiolucencies were present by the end of the first postoperative year, and in 81 per cent of the knees there was no further change. Although a special attempt was made to determine any evidence of wear of the polyethylene tibial component, we were unable to demonstrate unequivocal wear in any knee. Our experience had led us to conclude that the long-term success of current total knee designs will probably not be significantly affected by polyethylene wear or loss of component fixation. The majority of failures in our series were attributed to errors in surgical technique.},

	abstract = {Several mechanoregulation algorithms proposed to control tissue differentiation during bone healing have been shown to accurately predict temporal and spatial tissue distributions during normal fracture healing. As these algorithms are different in nature and biophysical parameters, it raises the question of which reflects the actual mechanobiological processes the best. The aim of this study was to resolve this issue by corroborating the mechanoregulatory algorithms with more extensive in vivo bone healing data from animal experiments. A poroelastic three-dimensional finite element model of an ovine tibia with a 2.4 mm gap and external callus was used to simulate the course of tissue differentiation during fracture healing in an adaptive model. The mechanical conditions applied were similar to those used experimentally, with axial compression or torsional rotation as two distinct cases. Histological data at 4 and 8 weeks, and weekly radiographs, were used for comparison. By applying new mechanical conditions, torsional rotation, the predictions of the algorithms were distinguished successfully. In torsion, the algorithms regulated by strain and hydrostatic pressure failed to predict healing and bone formation as seen in experimental data. The algorithm regulated by deviatoric strain and fluid velocity predicted bridging and healing in torsion, as observed in vivo. The predictions of the algorithm regulated by deviatoric strain alone did not agree with in vivo data. None of the algorithms predicted patterns of healing entirely similar to those observed experimentally for both loading modes. However, patterns predicted by the algorithm based on deviatoric strain and fluid velocity was closest to experimental results. It was the only algorithm able to predict healing with torsional loading as seen in vivo.},

	abstract = {Most long-bone fractures heal through indirect or secondary fracture healing, a complex process in which endochondral ossification is an essential part and bone is regenerated by tissue differentiation. This process is sensitive to the mechanical environment, and several authors have proposed mechano-regulation algorithms to describe it using strain, pore pressure and/or interstitial fluid velocity as biofeedback variables. The aim of this study was to compare various mechano-regulation algorithms' abilities to describe normal fracture healing in one computational model. Additionally, we hypothesized that tissue differentiation during normal fracture healing could be equally well regulated by the individual mechanical stimuli, e.g. deviatoric strain, pore pressure or fluid velocity. A biphasic finite element model of an ovine tibia with a 3mm fracture gap and callus was used to simulate the course of tissue differentiation during normal fracture healing. The load applied was regulated in a biofeedback loop, where the load magnitude was determined by the interfragmentary movement in the fracture gap. All the previously published mechano-regulation algorithms studied, simulated the course of normal fracture healing correctly. They predicted (1) intramembranous bone formation along the periosteum and callus tip, (2) endochondral ossification within the external callus and cortical gap, and (3) creeping substitution of bone towards the gap from the initial lateral osseous bridge. Some differences between the effects of the algorithms were seen, but they were not significant. None of the volumetric components, i.e. pore pressure or fluid velocity, alone were able to correctly predict spatial or temporal tissue distribution during fracture healing. However, simulation as a function of only deviatoric strain accurately predicted the course of normal fracture healing. This suggests that the deviatoric component may be the most significant mechanical parameter to guide tissue differentiation during indirect fracture healing.},

	abstract = {The apparent properties of cancellous bone are determined by a combination of both hard tissue properties and microstructural organization. A method is desired to extract the underlying hard tissue properties from simple mechanical tests, free from the complications of microstructure. It has been suggested that microCT voxel-based large-scale finite element models could be employed to accomplish this goal (van Rietbergen et al., 1995, Journal of Biomechanics, 28, 69-81). This approach has recently been implemented and it is becoming increasingly popular as finite element models increase in size and sophistication (Fyhrie et al., 1997, Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Orthopaedic Research Society, San Francisco, CA, p. 815; van Rietbergen et al., 1997, Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Orthopaedic Research Society, San Francisco, CA, p. 62). However, no direct quantitative measurements of the accuracy of this method applied to porous structures such as cancellous bone have been made. This project demonstrates the feasibility of this approach by quantifying its best-case accuracy in determining the trabecular hard tissue modulus of analogues fabricated of a material with known material properties determined independently by direct testing. In addition we were able to assess the impact of mesh size and boundary conditions on accuracy. We found that the assumption of a frictionless boundary condition in the parallel plate compression loading configuration was a significant source of error that could be overcome with the use of rigid end-caps similar to those used by Keaveny et al. (1997 Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 15(1), 101-110). In conclusion, we found that this approach is an effective method for determining the average trabecular hard tissue properties of human cancellous bone with an expected practical accuracy level better than 5\%.},

A mathematical counterpart of this principle is derived by adding a remodeling rule for the rate-of-change of the full anisotropic stiffness tensor (all 21 independent terms) to the density rate-of-change rule adapted from an existing isotropic theory. As a result, anisotropy and density patterns develop such that the local stiffness tensor is optimal for the given series of applied loadings. The method does not rely on additional morphological measures of trabecular orientation. Furthermore, assumptions of material symmetry are not required, and any observed regions of orthotropy, transverse isotropy, or isotropy are a result entirely of the functional adaptation of the bone and not the consequence of a modeling assumption.

For the success of this treatment, a profound understanding is needed of the mechanical properties of both the native bone tissue and the construct.

This paper demonstrates that microfocus computer tomography (microCT) based finite element modelling (FEM) can have an important contribution to the field of functional bone engineering as a biomechanical analysis tool to quantify the stress and strain state in native bone tissue and in tissue constructs. Its value is illustrated by two cases: (1) in vivo microCT-based FEM for the analysis of peri-implant bone adaptation and (2) design of biomechanically optimised bone scaffolds. The first case involves a combined animal experimental and numerical study, in which the peri-implant bone adaptive response is monitored by means of in vivo microCT scanning. In the second case microCT-based finite element models were created of native trabecular bone and bone scaffolds and a mechanical analysis of both structures was performed. Procedures to optimise the mechanical properties of bone scaffolds, in relation to those of native trabecular bone are discussed.},

The model should be able to predict the effect of surgical interventions and give insight into the function of pelvic floor muscles. Because there was a lack of any information concerning morphological parameters of the pelvic floor muscle structures, we performed an experimental measurement to uncover those morphological parameters. Geometric parameters as well as muscle parameters of the pelvic floor muscles were measured on an embalmed female cadaver. A three-dimensional (3D) geometric data set of the pelvic floor including muscle fibre directions was obtained using a palpator device. A 3D surface model based on the experimental data, needed for mathematical modelling of the pelvic floor, was created. For all parts of the diaphragma pelvis, the optimal muscle fibre length was determined by laser diffraction measurements of the sarcomere length. In addition, other muscle parameters such as physiological cross-sectional area and total muscle fibre length were determined. Apart from these measurements we obtained a data set of the pelvic floor structures based on nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the same cadaver specimen. The purpose of this experiment was to discover the relationship between the MRI morphology and geometrical parameters obtained from the previous measurements. The produced data set is not only important for biomechanical modelling of the pelvic floor muscles, but it also describes the geometry of muscle fibres and is useful for functional analysis of the pelvic floor in general. By the use of many reference landmarks all these morphologic data concerning fibre directions and optimal fibre length can be morphed to the geometrical data based on segmentation from MRI scans. These data can be directly used as an input for building a mathematical model based on FE theory.},

	abstract = {Cylindrical porous-coated implants were placed in the distal femoral metaphyses of twenty dogs and were subjected to zero, twenty, forty, or 150 micrometers of oscillatory motion for eight hours each day for six weeks with use of a specially designed loading apparatus. The in vivo skeletal responses to the different magnitudes of relative motion were evaluated. Histological analysis demonstrated growth of bone into the porous coatings of all of the implants, including those that had been subjected to 150 micrometers of motion. However, the ingrown bone was in continuity with the surrounding bone only in the groups of implants that had not been subjected to motion or that had been subjected to twenty micrometers of motion; in contrast, the implants that had been subjected to forty micrometers of motion were surrounded in part by trabecular bone but also in part by fibrocartilage and fibrous tissue, and those that had been subjected to 150 micrometers of motion were surrounded by dense fibrous tissue. Trabecular microfractures were identified around three of the five implants that had been subjected to forty micrometers of motion and around four of the five that had been subjected to 150 micrometers of motion, suggesting that the ingrown bone had failed at the interface because of the large movements. The architecture of the surrounding trabecular bone also was altered by the micromotion of the implant. The implants that had stable ingrowth of bone were surrounded by a zone of trabecular atrophy, whereas those that had unstable ingrowth of bone were surrounded by a zone of trabecular hypertrophy. The trabeculae surrounding the fibrocartilage or fibrous tissue that had formed around the implants that had been subjected to forty or 150 micrometers of motion had been organized into a shell of dense bone tangential to the implant (that is, a neocortex outside the non-osseous tissue).},

	abstract = {Does "cement disease" exist? The bony environment surrounding a loosened cemented prosthesis is an abnormal pathologic condition which, if left unattended, will progress to a total failure of the joint including an inhibition of function and immobilizing pain. That biomaterial properties of the cement used for fixation also contribute to the pathologic state separates this disease from other modes of loosening. This leads inevitably to the conclusion that "cement disease" does exist. Methyl methacrylate has revolutionized the treatment of severe joint dysfunction. There can be no doubt that improving surgical technique, cement handling, and the cement itself will continue to improve the results and reduce the incidence of failure due to loosening. Cement is undoubtedly satisfactory for elderly patients with low activity levels and relatively short life expectancies. However, because of the inherent biologic and biomechanical properties of methyl methacrylate, it is unlikely that it can be rendered satisfactory in the long run for the young, the active, or the overweight patient, for whom alternatives are currently being sought. In such cases, the elimination of "cement disease" can only occur with the elimination of cement. Alternatives include the search for other grouting materials and the development of prostheses with satisfactory surfaces for either press-fit or biologic ingrowth.},

	abstract = {Conceptually, the elastic characteristics of cancellous bone could be predicted directly from the trabecular morphology–or architecture–and by the elastic properties of the tissue itself. Although hardly any experimental evidence exists, it is often implicitly assumed that tissue anisotropy has a negligible effect on the apparent elastic properties of cancellous bone. The question addressed in this paper is whether this is actually true. If it is, then micromechanical finite element analysis (micro-FEA) models, representing trabecular architecture, using an 'effective isotropic tissue modulus' should be able to predict apparent elastic properties of cancellous bone. To test this, accurate multi-axial compressive mechanical tests of 29 whale bone specimens were simulated with specimen-specific micro-FEA computer models built from true three-dimensional reconstructions. By scaling the micro-FEA predictions by a constant tissue modulus, 92\% of the variation of Young's moduli determined experimentally could be explained. The correlation even increased to 95\% when the micro-FEA moduli were scaled to the isotropic tissue moduli of individual specimens. Excellent agreement was also found in the elastic symmetry axes and anisotropy ratios. The prediction of Poisson's ratios was somewhat less precise at 85\% correlation. The results support the hypothesis; for practical purposes, the concept of an 'effective isotropic tissue modulus' concept is a viable one. They also suggest that the value of such a modulus for individual cases might be inferred from the average tissue density, hence the degree of mineralization. Future studies must clarify how specific the tissue modulus should be for different types of bone if adequate predictions of elastic behavior are to be made in this way.},

	abstract = {The hypothesis that trabecular morphology can predict the elastic properties of cancellous bone has only partly been verified and no predictive analytical model is currently available. Such models are becoming increasingly relevant as the resolution levels of three-dimensional scanning techniques approach the size of trabeculae. This study took advantage of micro-finite-element methods and tested the aforementioned hypothesis in normal cancellous bone material collected at six anatomical locations from 56 individuals. Numerical analysis was based on high-resolution three-dimensional computer reconstructions of cancellous bone specimens from which the complete elastic characteristics and trabecular morphology, represented by three different fabric measures (the mean intercept length and two volume-based ones), were calculated. Each fabric measure was analyzed individually using the tensorial relationships derived by Cowin (Mech Mater 4:137-147; 1985). Models for both stiffness and compliance entries were developed. The models based on stiffness entries could explain 93.4\%-95.6\% of the variance, whereas those based on compliance entries could explain 89.2\%-89.4\%. When using the former model, the MIL (mean intercept length measure) performed slightly better than the two volume-based measures, VO (volume orientation) and SVD (star volume distribution), with 23\% less remaining variance. The high correlations found strongly support the hypothesis and increase the hope that, on the basis of information on trabecular morphology, it will be possible to obtain considerably better estimates of bone quality in vivo compared with the rough two-dimensional density measurements used today.},

This study examined the effect of metastatic lesions on the material properties and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) data of trabecular bone. Twelve distal femora were obtained, four with lytic and/or blastic metastatic lesions (group L), four without lesions but from donors who died from breast, prostate, or lung cancer (group NL), and four from donors with no cancer (group NC). Each specimen was CT scanned, and 56, 15x15x15-mm cubes of trabecular bone were cut. QCT density (rho(QCT)), compressive elastic modulus (E), compressive yield and ultimate strengths (S(y) and S(u)), and ash density (rho(ash)) of each cube were determined. Regression analysis was performed between rho(ash) and E, S(y), S(u) and rho(QCT), and analysis of covariance was used to identify differences between groups. Power relationships that did not depend on group (p {\textgreater}/= 0.1) were found between E and rho(ash) (0.74 {\textless}/= r {\textless}/= 0.84; p{\textless}0.001) and between strength (S(y) and S(u)) and rho(ash) (r {\textgreater}/= 0.94; p{\textless}0.001). rho(ash) was strongly related to rho(QCT) (r {\textgreater}/= 0.99; p{\textless}0.001). These results indicate that metastatic disease does not significantly impair the ability of QCT to provide an accurate and precise estimate of rho(ash) that can be used to estimate mechanical properties of trabecular bone with and without metastases.},

To lay the groundwork for new clinical techniques for assessing the risk of pathological fracture, we identified relationships between density measured using quantitative computed tomography (rhoQCT), longitudinal mechanical properties, and ash density (rhoAsh) of cortical bone from femoral diaphyses with and without metastatic lesions from breast, prostate, and lung cancer (bone with metastases from six donors; bone without metastases from one donor with cancer and two donors without cancer). Moderately strong linear relationships between rhoQCT and elastic modulus, strength, and rhoAsh were found for bone with metastases (0.73{\textless}r{\textless}0.93, P{\textless}0.05). After accounting for differences in rhoQCT, the elastic modulus, compressive strength, tensile yield strain, and rhoAsh of bone with metastatic lesions differed from those of bone from donors without cancer (P{\textless}0.01). However, differences in tensile strength or compressive yield strain, after controlling for rhoQCT, were not found. Thus, these cancers degrade the elastic modulus and compressive strength, but not the tensile strength, of cortical bone beyond the amount that would be expected from decreased density alone. The rhoQCT-mechanical property relationships reported may be useful for evaluating bone integrity and assessing the risk of fracture of bone with metastases.},

Lateral surfaces are defined by stacking up the slices and making use of the vectorized data. Intermediate and oblique cross-sections can be obtained by an interpolation technique. The constructed model was used as input data for the finite element analysis. To understand the stress distributions before and after the cementless type of total hip replacement, a three-dimensional finite element stress analysis of the bone-implant system was carried out, assuming micromotions between the stem and the femur.

The disease is common and readily diagnosed by the measurement of bone mineral with single- or dual-energy absorptiometry. Such measurements have high specificity but lower sensitivity, so that the value of the technique is greater for those identified as being at higher risk. Against this background there is little evidence that osteoporosis can usefully be tackled by a public health policy to influence risk factors such as smoking, exercise and nutrition. This suggests that it is appropriate to consider targetting of treatment with agents affecting bone metabolism to susceptible individuals. Since the main benefits of the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are probably on cardiovascular morbidity, the major role for selective screening is to direct non-HRT interventions. An appropriate time to consider screening and intervention is at the menopause, but screening at later ages is also worthy of consideration. Since the cost of screening is low and that of bone-active drugs is high, the selective use of screening techniques will improve the cost-benefit ratio of intervention.},

Results demonstrate a loss of trabecular bone and architecture following ovariectomy (p {\textless} 0.001), and a marked inhibition of trabecular bone loss in the estrogen treated group (p {\textless} 0.001). A similar change in architecture can be visualized in images obtained by high resolution MR microscopy.

Micro-CT and MR images were also obtained to study age related changes in the stifle joint of the guinea pig. Significant boney changes can be seen in the tibia and femur from the animals at various ages. Changes in cartilage and joint space can also be visualized in the images. The utility of micro-CT imaging in evaluating the mouse skeletal system is illustrated by obtaining morphological and architectural details from high resolution images of the mouse hind limb and proximal tibia, respectively.

	abstract = {Using a protocol designed to reduce experimental artifacts associated with the conventional compression test for trabecular bone, we performed in vitro mechanical testing on bovine tibial trabecular bone to obtain accurate descriptions of the elastic and yield behaviors. Reduced-section cylindrical specimens were preconditioned for eight tension-compression (+/- 0.5\% strain) cycles and then loaded to failure either in tension (n = 15) or compression (n = 14). We found that the pre-yield behavior for every specimen was fully linear, indicating that the initial nonlinear 'toe' is an experimental artifact. Analysis of variance on the moduli indicated that there was no significant difference between the tensile and compressive moduli before preconditioning. However, preconditioning decreased the tensile and compressive moduli on average by 8.8\% (p {\textless} 0.01) and 5.3\% (p {\textless} 0.01), respectively, with the decrease in tensile modulus being larger (p {\textless} 0.01). These small but significant decreases in modulus suggest that initial yielding involves microstructural damage (as opposed to plastic slip) of individual trabeculae and also indicate that the tensile and/or the compressive yield strain of (bovine tibial) trabecular bone is less than 0.5\%. The mean tensile strength was approximately 70\% of the mean compressive strength, although this difference in strengths may have been affected by the preconditioning-induced damage. Taken together, these results suggest that there are more similarities between the elastic and yield behaviors of trabecular and cortical bone than had been assumed previously.},

	abstract = {We sought to quantify the systematic and random errors associated with end-artifacts in the platens compression test for trabecular bone. Our hypothesis was that while errors may depend on anatomic site, they do not depend on apparent density and therefore have substantial random components. Trabecular bone specimens were first tested nondestructively using newly developed accurate protocols and then were tested again using the platens compression test. Percentage differences in modulus between the techniques (bovine proximal tibia [n = 18] and humerus [n = 17] and human lumbar spine, [n = 9]) were in the range of 4-86\%. These differences did not depend on anatomic site (p = 0.21) and were only weakly dependent on apparent density and specimen aspect ratio (r2 {\textless} 0.10). The mean percentage difference in modulus was 32.6\%, representing the systematic component of the end-artifact error. Neglecting the minor variations explained by density and specimen size (approximately 10\%), an upper bound on the random error from end-artifacts in this experiment was taken as the SD of the modulus difference (+/-18.2\%). Based on a synthesis of data taken from this study and from the literature, we concluded that the systematic underestimation error in the platens compression test can be only approximated and is in the range of 20-40\%; the substantial random error (+/-12.5\%) confounds correction, particularly when the sample size is small. These errors should be considered when interpreting results from the platens test, and more accurate testing techniques should be used when such errors are not acceptable.},

However, the difference between individual values of the tensile and compressive strengths increased linearly with increasing modulus and density, being negligible for low moduli, but substantial for high moduli. By contrast, both the tensile and compressive yield strains were independent of modulus and density, with the yield strain being 30\% lower for tensile loading. Thus, the difference between the tensile and compressive strengths of bovine tibial trabecular bone depends on the modulus, but the difference between yield strains does not. This phenomenon may explain in part that conflicting conclusions reached previously on the tensile and compressive strengths of trabecular bone since the mean modulus has varied among different studies. Realizing that our data pertain only directly to bovine tibial trabecular bone for longitudinal loading, our results nevertheless suggest that failure parameters based on strains may provide more powerful and general comparisons of the failure properties for trabecular bone than measures based on stress.},

	abstract = {The mechanical behavior of damaged trabecular bone may play a role in the etiology of age-related spine fractures since damaged bone exists in and may weaken the elderly vertebral body. To describe some characteristics of damaged trabecular bone, we measured the changes in modulus and strength that occur when bovine trabecular bone is loaded in compression to various strains beyond its elastic range. Twenty-three reduced-section specimens, taken from 17 different bones, were loaded from 0-X-0-9\% strain, where X was one of four strains: 1.0\% (n = 7), 2.5\% (n = 6), 4.0\% (n = 5), or 5.5\% (n = 5). We found that modulus was reduced for all applied strains, whereas strength was reduced only for strain levels {\textgreater} or = 2.5\%; the percentage changes in modulus and strength were independent of Young's modulus but were highly dependent on the magnitude of the applied strains; modulus was always reduced more than strength; and simple statistical models, using knowledge of only the applied strains, predicted well the percentage reductions in modulus (r2 = 0.97) and strength (r2 = 0.74). The modulus reductions reported here are in qualitative agreement with those for cortical bone in tensile loading, supporting the concept that the damage behaviors of cortical and trabecular bone are similar for low strains ({\textless} or = 4.0\%). In addition, because modulus was always reduced more than strength, damaged trabecular bone may be stress protected in vivo by redistribution of stresses to undamaged bone.},

	title = {Mechanical behavior of human trabecular bone after overloading},
	volume = {17},
	abstract = {With the etiology of osteoporotic fractures as motivation, the goal of this study was to characterize the mechanical behavior of human trabecular bone after overloading. Specifically, we quantified the reductions in modulus and strength and the development of residual deformations and determined the dependence of these parameters on the applied strain and apparent density. Forty cylindrical specimens of human L1 vertebral trabecular bone were destructively loaded in compression at 0.5\% strain per second to strains of up to 3.0\% and then immediately unloaded to zero stress and reloaded. (An ancillary experiment on more readily available bovine bone had been performed previously to develop this testing protocol.) In general, the reloading stress-strain curve had a short initial nonlinear region with a tangent modulus similar to Young's modulus. This was followed by an approximately linear region spanning to 0.7\% strain, with a reduced residual modulus. The reloading curve always approached the extrapolated envelope of the original loading curve. Percent modulus reduction (between Young's and residual), a quantitative measure of mechanical damage, ranged from 5.2 to 91.0\% across the specimens. It increased with increasing plastic strain (r2 = 0.97) but was not related to modulus or apparent density. Percent strength reduction, in the range of 3.6-63.8\%, increased with increasing plastic strain (r2 = 0.61) and decreasing apparent density (r2 = 0.23). The residual strains of up to 1.05\% depended strongly on applied strain (r2 = 0.96). Statistical comparisons with previous data for bovine tibial bone lend substantial generality to these trends and provide an envelope of expected behavior for other sites. In addition to providing a basis for biomechanical analysis of the effects of damage in trabecular bone at the organ level, these findings support the concept that occasional overloads may increase the risk of fracture by substantially degrading the mechanical properties of the underlying trabecular bone.},

	abstract = {The principal objectives of this study were to determine the mathematical dependency of the compressive mechanical properties of human bone on several commonly used measures of bone composition, and to assess variations in this dependency based upon the composition range spanned by the data. Destructive mechanical tests were conducted along the superior-inferior axis of 496 cubic specimens of human trabecular and cortical bone from five male donors (ages 46-84 yr), including specimens from lumbar vertebrae and femoral metaphyses and diaphyses. There was over a 3000-fold variation in strength (S, ultimate stress) and over a 20,000-fold variation in stiffness (E, elastic modulus) over the range of apparent dry density (rho a = 0.05-1.89 g cm-3), apparent ash density (rho alpha = 0.03-1.22 g cm-3) and mineral content (alpha = 17.4-66.2\%) examined. Both linear and power models produced very high correlations (R2 {\textgreater} 0.81) between mechanical properties and bone composition, but the linear models resulted in a much greater percent deviation (PD) of the predicted dependent variable with respect to the measured value, in comparison to power models. The best correlations were obtained using rho alpha as the only independent variable: S (MPa) = 117 rho alpha 1.93 +/- 0.04 (R2 = 0.969, PD = 29.9, E (GPa) = 10.5 rho alpha 2.57 +/-0.04 (R2 = 0.965, PD = 46.7). Power models of bone stiffness and strength, incorporating only low density data (rho alpha {\textless} 0.2 g cm-3, rho a {\textless} 0.3), were characterized by approximately squared exponents and these models underestimated the stiffness (five-fold) and overestimated the strength (two-fold) for higher density data, which were characterized by exponents greater than two. Using a subset of the data based upon an apparent dry density range of 0.22 {\textless} rho a {\textless} 1.89 g cm-3, it was possible to obtain a mathematical relationship in which bone stiffness and strength were precisely proportional to the cube and square, respectively, of the apparent dry density. These results indicate that the mathematical dependency of bone compressive mechanical properties on composition is closely dependent upon the density and mineral content range examined and, in terms of a single compositional measure, is best predicted by apparent ash density expressed as a power function.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To provide a clear overview of the literature on the relationship between increased lateral ankle ligament damage and anterior talocrural-joint laxity. DESIGN: A systematic review of the literature. BACKGROUND: Diagnostic methods for inversion injuries of the ankle have remained controversial throughout the years. An instrumented test for anterior talocrural-joint laxity could be a diagnostic tool for evaluation of anterior lateral ankle ligament function. METHODS: An advanced electronic database search using MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to find studies describing the correlation between lateral ankle ligament damage and talocrural-joint laxity. Two reviewers assessed the methodological quality for each study and agreement was noted. Two reviewers extracted all relevant data with respect to methodology, motion constraints and laxity measurement. RESULTS: The quality assessment resulted in 5 studies being scored as high quality and 5 as low quality. Different test devices were used to apply the load and measure the displacement. All in vitro tests applied a load to the calcaneus and subsequently measured the translation of the talus and/or calcaneus relative to the tibial dome. Rotation in the transversal and frontal plane was restricted in 8 tests. After analysis of the results presented by nine different studies, the mean value of anterior talocrural-joint laxity with intact ligaments is 4.2 mm. After sectioning of the anterior talofibular ligament, the mean anterior laxity value is 6.5 mm. The mean anterior laxity value after sectioning of the calcaneofibular ligament increases to 8.4 mm. The mean anterior laxity value with the foot in dorsal flexion (3.1 mm) is less than the mean value with the foot in neutral position (4.5 mm) or in plantar flexion (4.7 mm). The applied load and the anterior laxity values between the different studies vary greatly. CONCLUSIONS: Each ligament section results in significantly increased talocrural-joint laxity. Talocrural-joint laxity can be used as a measure for damage to the anterior talofibular ligament and/or the calcaneofibular ligament. From this review, it is neither possible to give universal recommendations about the optimal flexion angle for testing talocrural-joint laxity as a measure for lateral ankle ligament function, nor to recommend the ideal load for performing the test. RELEVANCE: The development of an instrumented test as a diagnostic tool for anterior talocrural-joint laxity in the clinical setting is near at hand and practicable.},

These measures included elastic modulus, strength, postfailure slope, strain during maximum stress, and first postfailure minimum stress. For each anatomic direction, analyses were performed to correlate these parameters with ash density. Each of these measures was significantly correlated with ash density at the p {\textless} 0.05 level for all test directions, except for postfailure slope, which was correlated in the mediolateral and superior-inferior directions, and strain during maximum stress, which was correlated only in the superior-inferior direction. The data from this study enable trilinear stress-strain relations to be estimated for proximal tibial trabecular bone of various densities, and can serve as a first step toward modeling the behavior of trabecular bone before, during, and after failure.},

	abstract = {Accurate in vivo measurement of tibiofemoral forces is important in total knee arthroplasty. These forces determine polyethylene stresses and cold-flow, stress distribution in the implant, and stress transfer to the underlying implant bone interface. Theoretic estimates of tibiofemoral forces have varied widely depending on the mathematical models used. The six degrees of freedom of motion, complex articular surface topography, changing joint-contact position, intra- and extra-articular ligaments, number of muscles crossing the knee joint, and the presence of the patellofemoral joint contribute to the difficulty in developing reliable models of the knee. A prototype instrumented total knee replacement tibial prosthesis was designed, manufactured, and tested. This prosthesis accurately measured all six components of tibial forces (R2{\textgreater}0.997). The prosthesis was also instrumented with an internal microtransmitter for wireless data transmission. Remote powering of the sealed implanted electronics was achieved using magnetic coil induction. This device can be used to validate existing models of the knee that estimate these forces or to develop more accurate models. In conjunction with kinematic data, accurate tibiofemoral force data may be used to design more effective knee-testing rigs and wear simulators. Additional uses are intraoperative measurement of forces to determine soft-tissue balancing and to evaluate the effects of rehabilitation, external bracing, and athletic activities, and activities of daily living.},

Telemetric analyses have previously been used to determine the in vivo loading of the human hip and more recently evaluated in the determination of in vivo knee loads. Mathematical modeling approaches can be categorized two ways; those that use optimization techniques to solve an indeterminate system and those that utilize a reduction method that minimizes the number of unknowns, keeping the system solvable as the number of equations of motion are equal to the number of unknown quantities. More recently, we have developed an approach that relies fully on the use of in vivo data from fluoroscopy, CT scanning, magnetic resonant imaging and a revised motion analysis technique that involves only two markers on each rigid body. A review of all techniques revealed a wide range of forces at the human knee, ranging from 1.9 to 7.2 times body weight during level walking.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate translational and rotational motions of the distal tibia relative to the talus in the sagittal and frontal planes. Ten subjects, each having a normal ankle and a total ankle arthroplasty on the opposite side (Buechel-Pappas Total Ankle, Endotec, South Orange, NJ), were studied under in vivo, weight-bearing conditions using video fluoroscopy. All ten subjects were judged to have a successful arthroplasty without demonstrable pain or ligament instability. Under weight-bearing conditions, each subject performed successive motions moving from maximum dorsiflexion to plantarflexion. At maximum dorsiflexion, both the normal and implanted ankles had similar sagittal midline talar contact positions but with plantar flexion, implanted ankles had increased posterior talar contact. Contact points on the distal tibia revealed that the lateral surface contacted at the midline or posterior throughout range-of-motion with minimal translation. The medial distal tibia contacted the talus posterior on plantarflexion and often moved anteriorly with dorsiflexion. This translation described relative external rotation of the distal tibia on plantar flexion and internal rotation on dorsiflexion. The measured distances were larger for the implanted ankles with higher variability. The average range-of-motion was 37.4 degrees for normal ankles and 32.3 degrees for implanted ankles. This study defines the normal kinematic rotational and translational motions of the ankle joint by accurately describing the three dimensional joint orientations. The implanted ankles experienced rotational and translational motions but had contacts more posterior, possibly related to surgical technique or alterations of ligamentous tension.},

Loads were applied in the superior-inferior direction along the principal trabecular orientation. These 'on-axis' yield strains were compared to those measured previously for high-density (0.51 +/- 0.06 g cm(-3)) bovine tibial trabecular bone (n = 44). Mean (+/- S.D.) yield strains for the human bone were 0.78 +/- 0.04\% in tension and 0.84 +/- 0.06\% in compression; corresponding values for the bovine bone were 0.78 +/- 0.04 and 1.09 +/- 0.12\%, respectively. Tensile yield strains were independent of the apparent density across the entire density range (human p = 0.40, bovine p = 0.64, pooled p = 0.97). By contrast, compressive yield strains were linearly correlated with apparent density for the human bone (p {\textless} 0.001) and the pooled data (p {\textless} 0.001), and a suggestive trend existed for the bovine data (p = 0.06). These results refute the hypothesis that on-axis yield strains for trabecular bone are independent of density for compressive loading, although values may appear constant over a narrow density range.

Twenty-three vertebral bodies (T11-L4, from 23 cadavers aged 20-90 years) were loaded once in compression to a randomized nominal strain level between 0.37 and 4.5\%, unloaded, and then reloaded to 10\% strain.

Percentage reductions in stiffness and ultimate load of up to 83.7 and 52.5\%, respectively, depended on both applied strain (r2 = 0.90 and r2 = 0.32, respectively) and density (r2 = 0.23 and r2 = 0.22, respectively). Development of residual strains is indicative of permanent deformations, whereas percentage reductions in stiffness are direct measures of effective mechanical damage. These results therefore demonstrate that substantial mechanical damage-which is not visible from radiographs-can develop in the vertebral body after isolated overloads, as well as subtle but significant permanent deformations. This behavior is similar to that observed previously for cylindrical cores of trabecular bone. Taken together, these findings indicate that the damage behavior of the lumbar and lower thoracic vertebral body is dominated by the trabecular bone and may be an important factor in the etiology of vertebral fracture.},

A modulus reduction method was formulated from elasto-plasticity theory, and was used to account for site-specific trabecular bone tissue damage. Trabecular bone tissue damage is illustrated using a large-scale, anatomically accurate, two-dimensional, microstructural finite element model of a human thoracic vertebral body. Four models with varying specifications for damage accumulation were subjected to compressive loading and unloading cycles. The numerical results and experimental validation demonstrated that the modulus reduction method reproduced the non-linear mechanical behaviour of vertebal trabecular bone. The iterative computational approach presented provides a methodology to study trabecular bone damage, and should provide researchers with a computational approach to study bone fracture and repair and to predict vertebral fragility.},

Initial implant stability is the most important factor in achieving bone ingrowth. Eccentric axial loading causing liftoff has been identified as a potential problem, but the role of torsion and shear stability is unclear. This study assesses the micromotion in two uncemented components subjected to eccentric axial (lateral, medial, posterior, anterior), shear, and torsional loads. Four configurations were tested: Tricon M (pegs) (Smith and Nephew Richards, Memphis, TN), Genesis (stem only) (Smith and Nephew Richards), Genesis with screws, and Genesis with pegs. Nine pairs of cadaver tibias were implanted, and cyclic loads were applied. Micromotion was measured with two linear variable differential transformers. Micromotion values for each mode of loading were compared using a one-way analysis of variance. Genesis with screws had the least micromotion for all applied loads (14-33 micrometers), whereas Genesis with stem only has the maximum value of micromotion (27-212 micrometers). Genesis wit and Tricon had intermediate ranges of micromotion (32-121 and 107-140 micrometers, respectively). It is concluded that peg fixation and stem fixation are inadequate and result in significant micromotion. Stem plus screws provides the most stable fixation and may be compatible with bone ingrowth.},

These differ in their approach to the measurement of outcome but all must be valid (they measure what they are designed to measure), reliable (they consistently produce the same score), and responsive (able to detect changes that may occur during a period). Responsiveness is crucial to distinguish those patients who benefit from a procedure from those who do not, and a more responsive test will theoretically be able to identify more subtle changes in patient status. The responsiveness of 6 different scoring systems was compared. The results are based on a cohort of 71 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty in a 7-month period. Responsiveness was determined by performing a paired t test among each patient's scores at 0, 3, and 6 months. The size of the resulting t value represented the comparative responsiveness of the 6 tests. The highest value achieved was with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index and the Knee Society clinical rating scale. The worst scores were achieved by Short Form-36 and time trade off, a utility method of measurement. If small differences between groups of patients are to be shown, measures of outcome that are more responsive to patient change should be used.},

	abstract = {This article presents a literature review of the current recommendations regarding sports after total joint replacement and also suggests scientifically based guidelines. Patients should be encouraged to remain physically active for general health and also for the quality of their bone. There is evidence that increased bone quality will improve prosthesis fixation and decrease the incidence of early loosening. To recommend a certain activity after total knee or hip replacement, factors such as wear, joint load, intensity and the type of prosthesis must be taken into account for each patient and sport. It has been shown that the reduction of wear is one of the main factors in improving long-term results after total joint replacement. Wear is dependent on the load, the number of steps and the material properties of total joint replacements. The most important question is, whether a specific activity is performed for exercise to obtain and maintain physical fitness or whether an activity is recreational only. To maintain physical fitness an endurance activity will be performed several times per week with high intensity. Since load will influence the amount of wear exponentially, only activities with low joint loads such as swimming, cycling or possibly power walking should be recommended. If an activity is carried out on a low intensity and therefore recreational base, activities with higher joint loads such as skiing or hiking can also be performed. It is unwise to start technically demanding activities after total joint replacement, as the joint loads and the risk for injuries are generally higher for these activities in unskilled individuals. Finally, it is important to distinguish between suitable activities following total knee and total hip replacement. To recommend suitable physical activities after total knee replacement, it is important to consider both the load and the knee flexion angle of the peak load, while for total hip replacement, which involves a ball and socket joint, the flexion angle does not play an important role. During activities such as hiking or jogging, high joint loads occur between 40 and 60 degrees of knee flexion where many knee designs are not conforming and high polyethylene inlay stress will occur. Regular jogging or hiking produces high inlay stress with the danger of delamination and polyethylene destruction for most current total knee prostheses. Based on these design differences between hip and knee replacements it is prudent to be more conservative after total knee arthroplasty than after total hip arthroplasty for activities that exhibit high joint loads in knee flexion.},

	abstract = {It has recently been shown that high-resolution computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have the potential to assess information about the microarchitecture of bone in a noninvasive way. However, due to the limited spatial resolution of the in vivo measurements, the individual trabeculae are not depicted with their true thickness. Nevertheless, the spacing of the structural elements allows the assessment of trabecular number. In a previous publication, the ridge number density (RND) was introduced as a measure for this structural index. It can be extracted from high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) images of patients and shows a reproducibility of 1.6\%. In this work the Ridge extraction procedure is compared to and calibrated with microcomputed tomography (microCT) measurements. Three-dimensional measurements of 15 bone biopsies are made with a 28-microm-resolution microCT scanner as well as with a 165-microm-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) scanner. For the latter, the same settings are used as for patient examinations. The 15 pairs of measurements are analyzed and the resulting structural indices are compared. The results show that structural indices such as trabecular number, mean thickness, and mean separation can be determined from the 3D pQCT data with an r2 of between 0.81 and 0.96 if the microCT data are taken as the gold standard. The calibration equation found for the bone volume fraction has an intercept of 0.04 and a slope of 0.86 (r2 = 0.98), and trabecular number as the main additional structural index shows a nonsignificant intercept and a calibration slope of 0.91 with the microCT. The calibration procedure can be used directly for patient examinations. Applied to time-series measurements it may be of value for monitoring and quantifying microarchitectural changes due to therapy or aging.},

	abstract = {Broadband ultrasonic attenuation (dB MHz cm-1, nBUA) was determined for specimens from 20 human calcanei, along with apparent density, elasticity (Young's modulus), and compressive strength. The calcanei were modified to provide "whole" (only soft tissue removed), "core" (mediolateral cores corresponding to in vivo measurement region), "can" (cortical end plates removed from core), and "def" (core defatted) samples. The nBUA values for the various modifications were highly correlated. The presence of the cortical endplates creates a significant nBUA, probably due to complex phase interactions. nBUAcan was a good predictor of elasticity (R2 = 75.7\%) and strength (R2 = 73.6\%). Apparent density was a better predictor of the mechanical variables than nBUA, with R2 values of 88.5\% for elasticity and 87.6\% for strength. The morphological anisotropy defined by "fabric" for the specimens was extremely uniform. The coefficient of variation in nBUA (40.5\%) and compressive strength (64.4\%) was significantly greater than for apparent density (23.5\%) and fabric (6.7\%). It is well known that a power law relationship exists between apparent density and elasticity or strength in cancellous bone. An interesting finding in this work is that there also appears to be a power law relationship between nBUA and apparent density, with an exponent of approximately 2, which, in the light of clinical implications, warrants further investigation.},

The average charge of TKA revision surgery was 73,696 dollars, (Cost was 36,848 dollars) with substantially higher costs for patients undergoing surgery because of deep joint infection, patients receiving a three component exchange, and patients receiving hinged or constrained condylar knee implants. The number of revision procedures is expected to increase from 37,544 in 2005 to 56,918 in 2030. Projected hospital costs for these procedures may exceed 2 billion dollars by 2030. The number of revision knee surgeries may increase by 66\% in the next 25 years.

DESIGN: Five matched human fresh frozen cadaver knees without prior pathology were used as paired specimens for comparison of cortical to cancellous screw fixation of tibial trays. BACKGROUND: Current cementless fixation of tibial trays in total knee arthroplasty is obtained by using a combination of stems, keels, posts, pegs, and screws. To date there has been no study comparing isolated cortical and cancellous screw fixation in cementless arthroplasty. METHODS: An Instron machine and a video digitizing system were used to examine tibial tray lift-off, subsidence, and anterior-posterior load to failure at the bone-implant interface in five matched pairs of knees and compare the difference between cancellous and cortical screw fixation. RESULTS: Non-destructive cyclic testing showed a significant difference between the two types of screws for tibial tray subsidence with cancellous fixation greater than cortical (P {\textless} 0.05), but not for lift-off (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Load to failure testing in anterior-posterior direction did not result in a significant difference between the two types of screws for initial stiffness and ultimate load (P {\textgreater} 0.05), but did result in a significant difference of energy absorbed to failure (P {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The difference in amount of subsidence between cortical and cancellous fixation could possibly be due to microfractures of the underlying trabecular bone with cancellous fixation. Neither screw type was able to completely fix the tibial tray to bone and prevent micromotion. Although the load at failure for anterior-posterior shear was similar for the two screw types, the energy absorbed was greater for the cortical screws which may be a result of additional strength provided by the cortical bone surrounding the screw.},

	abstract = {Reliable determination of bone loss in the skeletal system depends on the accuracy of bone mineral density (BMD) measurements. We investigated short-term and long-term accuracy in vitro and in vivo using a new, commercially available special-purpose computed tomography scanner (Single Energy Peripheral QCT: XCT 900, Stratec FRG) for BMD measurements. Using a phantom, the long-term accuracy (3 months) in vitro yielded a coefficient of variation (cv) of 0.18\%. Repeated measurements in 37 patients showed excellent reproducibility, with a cv of 0.71\%. The differentiation into groups of low, average and high trabecular bone density demonstrated values of 0.61\%, 0.59\% and 0.98\%, respectively for cv. BMD determination with pQCT is a high-precision method. It seems to be suitable for detection of trabecular bone loss in the range of the annual decrease in bone mass, provided the forearm is positioned with maximum care.},

	abstract = {Correct positioning of the tibial component in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) must take into account both an optimal bone coverage (defined by a maximal cortical bearing with posteromedial and anterolateral support) and satisfactory patellofemoral tracking. Consequently, a compromise position must be found by the surgeon during the operation to simultaneously meet these two requirements. Moreover, tibial tray positioning depends upon the tibial torsion, which has been shown to act mainly in the proximal quarter of the tibia. Therefore, the correct application of the tibial tray is also theoretically related to the level of bone resection. In this study, we first quantified the torsional profile given by an optimal bone coverage for a symmetrical tibial tray design and for an asymmetrical one. Then, for the two types of tibial trays, we measured the angle difference between optimal bone coverage and an alignment on the middle of the tibial tubercule. Results showed that the values of the torsional profile given by the symmetrical tray were more scattered than those from the asymmetrical one. However, determination of the mean differential angle between the position providing optimal bone coverage and the one providing the best patellofemoral tracking indicated that the symmetrical prosthetic tray offered the best compromise between these two requirements. Although the tibiofemoral joint is known to be asymmetric in both shape and dimension, the asymmetrical tray chosen in this study was found to fulfill this compromise with more difficulty.},

The models were experimentally validated by strain gauge measurements (principal stress). The correlation coefficients (r) between the three methods (geometry-based FEM, voxel-based FEM, strain gauge measurements) were found to be in the range 0.91-0.94 (r2: 0.84-0.88). The relationships between the samples are highly significant (P = 0.001), where the strain gauge results are the independent variables. These results suggest that the validity with respect to the principal stress of a voxel-based modelling is similar to the validity of geometry-based modelling. In summary, therefore, we conclude that voxel-based meshing allows a straightforward interfacing with computerized tomography (CT) scans and might contribute to a clinically applicable FEM technology.},

	abstract = {Stress analysis of the cement fixation of orthopaedic implants to bone is frequently carried out using finite element analysis. However the stress distribution in the cement layer is usually intricate, and it is difficult to report it in a way that facilitates comparison of implants for pre-clinical testing. To study this problem, and make recommendations for stress reporting, a finite element analysis of a hip prosthesis implanted into a synthetic composite femur is developed. Three cases are analyzed: a fully bonded implant, a debonded implant, and a debonded implant where the cement is removed distal to the stem tip. In addition to peak stresses, and contour and vector plots, a stressed volume and probability-of-failure analysis is reported. It is predicted that the peak stress is highest for the debonded stem, and that removal of the distal cement more than halves this peak stress. This would suggest that omission of the distal cement is good for polished prostheses (as practiced for the Exeter design). However, if the percentage of cement stressed above a certain threshold (say 3 MPa) is considered, then the removal of distal cement is shown to be disadvantageous because a higher volume of cement is stressed to above the threshold. Vector plots clearly demonstrate the different load transfer for bonded and debonded prostheses: A bonded stem generates maximum tensile stresses in the longitudinal direction, whereas a debonded stem generates most tensile stresses in the hoop direction, except near the tip where tensile longitudinal stresses occur due to subsidence of the stem. Removal of the cement distal to the tip allows greater subsidence but alleviates these large stresses at the tip, albeit at the expense of increased hoop stresses throughout the mantle. It is concluded that a thorough analysis of cemented implants should not report peak stress, which can be misleading, but rather stressed volume, and that vector plots should be reported if a precise analysis of the load transfer mechanism is required.},

(1990, J Biomed. Engng 12, 389-397). The metacarpi were then equipped with 12 rosette strain gauges and loaded non-destructively in a mechanical testing machine. The bones and the models were loaded in axial compression, with the load evenly distributed across the distal row of carpal bones, and with a point load placed mediad to the sagittal midline, to a load equivalent to three times body weight (-15 kN); and in sagittal four-point bending to -2 kN. Maximum and minimum principal strains from the models were compared with those at the strain gauge rosettes. There were significant (p {\textless} 0.001) and strong (0.69 {\textless} r {\textless} 0.90) correlations between predicted and observed surface principal strains, most often resolving as second- or third-order polynomial relationships. In most cases, particularly at extreme strain magnitudes, the models tended to overestimate the observed strain magnitudes. These data suggest that the models are robust and accurate predictors of surface strains. Validation of these models lends further support for the use of this method of automated three-dimensional FE modeling, with its emphasis on accurate, individualized portrayal of structural geometry and material distribution, in research applications, and specifically for the use of these models in the study of the biology and mechanics of the equine metacarpus.},

	volume = {17},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of malalignment on stresses in tibial polyethylene component of total knee prostheses. DESIGN: A three-dimensional finite element analysis was used to calculate the contact stress and von Mises stress in the tibial polyethylene component subjected to a compressive load, and the malalignment situations were simulated. BACKGROUND: Many biomechanical studies to investigate the stresses in tibial polyethylene component were assumed at the ideal contact alignment. The effect of malalignment on stresses in tibial polyethylene component was not investigated extensively. METHODS: Three-dimensional finite element models of the tibiofemoral joint of knee prostheses for three different designs were constructed. Three malalignment conditions including the medial translation (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mm), internal rotation (1 degree, 3 degree and 5 degree), and varus tilt (1 degree, 3 degree and 5 degree) of the femoral component relative to the tibial component were simulated. A compression load of 3000 N was applied to the tibiofemoral joint at 0 degree of flexion. The maximum contact stress and von Mises stress in the tibial component were compared to investigate the effects of malalignment. RESULTS: In comparing with the neutral position, the greatest increase of maximum contact stress were 67.6\%, 14.3\% and 145.9\% and the greatest increase of maximum von Mises stress were 92.5\%, 22.7\% and 120.6\% in maltranslation, internal rotation and varus tilt simulations, respectively. CONCLUSION: The greatest increase of contact stress and von Mises stress was occurred in the high conformity flat-on-flat design of knee prosthesis under the severest malalignment condition. The high conformity curve-on-curve design of knee prosthesis has the minimal risk of polyethylene wear under the malalignment conditions. RELEVANCE: This study revealed the importance of malalignment effect on stresses in tibial polyethylene component. Polyethylene wear in surface replacement total knees will be minimal when a high conformity curve-on-curve knee design is used and the rotational line between the femoral and tibial components has the least effect on polyethylene wear but varus/valgus malalignment, even with the best designed prosthesis will still accelerate wear.},

	abstract = {Researchers have tried to assess the morphological and mechanical characteristics of bone using various methods with a limited success (Mow and Hayes, 1997, and Cowin, 2001). This may be due to the complexity for documentation and characterization of architecture by the anisotropic and nonhomogeneous characteristic of the bone. The bones of the shoulder joint complex are particularly deprived of information on their mechanical and morphological properties. Very little is known for example on the mechanics and morphology of the glenoid of the shoulder,. The present work presents an attempt to identify a proper method for the measurement and characterization of the morphology and mechanics of bone, particularly in the glenoid. Our results show that trabecular lines are directed at 82.15Â° Â± 7.98Â° relative to the glenoid articular surface, young's modulus obtained from CT scan was 230 Â± 8 MP, and the elastic tensors obtained from cadaver were 326 Â± 78 MPa for E2222, 144 Â± 22 MPa for E1111=E3333, 49 Â± 7 MPa for E3311, 59 Â± 9 MPa for E1122=E2233, 51 Â± 8 MPa for E1313, and 70 Â± 10 MPa for E1212=E2323.

Both the length and the cross-sectional area of the specimen had a highly significant influence on the mechanical behaviour (p less than 0.0001). Within the actual range of length (2.75-11.0 mm) the normalized stiffness (Young's modulus) was related nearly linearly to the specimen length. This dependency on specimen length is suggested to be caused mainly by structural disintegrity of the trabecular specimens near the surface. The normalized stiffness (Young's modulus) was also positively correlated to the cross-sectional area. This dependency on cross-sectional area is probably due to friction-induced stress inhomogeneity at the platen-specimen interface. A cube with side length 6.5 mm or a cylindrical specimen with 7.5 mm diameter and 6.5 mm length are suggested as standard specimens for comparative studies on trabecular bone mechanics.},

	abstract = {The macroscopic mechanical properties of trabecular bone can be predicted by its architecture using theoretical relationships between the elastic and architectural properties. Microdamage caused by overloading or fatigue decreases the apparent elastic moduli of trabecular bone requiring these relationships to be modified to predict the damaged elastic properties. In the case of isotropic damage, the apparent level elastic properties could be determined by multiplying all of the elastic constants by a single scalar factor. If the damage is anisotropic, the elastic constants may change by differing factors and the material coordinate system could become misaligned with the fabric coordinate system. High-resolution finite element models were used to simulate damage overloading on seven trabecular bone specimens subjected to pure shear strain in two planes. Comparison of the apparent elastic moduli of the specimens before and after damage showed that the reduction of the elastic moduli was anisotropic. This suggests that the microdamage within the specimens was inhomogeneous. However, after damage the specimens exhibited nearly orthotropic material symmetry as they did before damage. Changes in the orientation of the orthotropic material coordinate system were also small and occurred primarily in the transverse plane. Thus, while damage in trabecular bone is anisotropic, the material coordinate system remains aligned with the fabric tensor.},

	abstract = {Total knee arthroplasty has shown excellent survivorship in short-term and intermediate-term studies. With longer follow-up, however, aseptic loosening becomes an increasing cause of failure. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scanning has shown that stress shielding occurs from altered mechanical loading. The purpose of this study is to determine if tibial stem design affects bone density in the longterm. Bone densities in the proximal tibia with and without cemented stems were compared at an average of 94 months after surgery. The bone quality under the Miller-Galante I prosthesis, which has 4 0.5-cm pegs, was compared with the bone quality under a Press-Fit Condylar prosthesis with a single 4-cm stem. Each group was also compared with the unoperated contralateral tibia. Results showed that there is a significantly reduced density of bone in the tibial metaphysis in the cemented stemmed group but not in the pegged group. There were no changes distally in the diaphyseal bone. This study supports the contention that the use of a cemented stem reduces proximal stresses and may result in proximal bone resorption. Although the use of a stem provides excellent resistance to lift-off and shear, it comes at a price. The proximal resorption may contribute to the persistence of tibial component loosening as a primary threat to survivorship. This bone loss may complicate revision surgery. Consideration should be given to using shorter tibial stems, less cement, or alternative designs that avoid long-stem fixation.},

	abstract = {The rates of fracture at sites with different relative amounts of cortical and trabecular bone (hip, spine, distal radius) have been used to make inferences about the pathomechanics of bone loss and the existence of type I and type II osteoporosis. However, fracture risk is directly related to the ratio of tissue stress to tissue strength, which in turn is dependent not only on tissue composition but also tissue geometry and the direction and magnitude of loading. These three elements determine how the load is distributed within the tissue. As a result, assumptions on the relative structural importance of cortical and trabecular bone, and how these tissues are affected by bone loss, can be inaccurate if based on regional tissue composition and bone density alone. To investigate the structural significance of cortical and trabecular bone in the proximal femur, and how it is affected by bone loss, we determined the stress distributions in a normal and osteoporotic femur resulting from loadings representing: (1) gait; and (2) a fall to the side with impact onto the greater trochanter. A three-dimensional finite element model was generated based on a representative femur selected from a large database of femoral geometries. Stresses were analyzed throughout the femoral neck and intertrochanteric regions. We found that the percentage of total load supported by cortical and trabecular bone was approximately constant for all load cases but differed depending on location. Cortical bone carried 30\% of the load at the subcapital region, 50\% at the mid-neck, 96\% at the base of the neck and 80\% at the intertrochanteric region. These values differ from the widely held assumption that cortical bone carries 75\% of the load in the femoral neck and 50\% of the load at the intertrochanteric region. During gait, the principal stresses were concentrated within the primary compressive system of trabeculae and in the cortical bone of the intertrochanteric region. In contrast, during a fall, the trabecular stresses were concentrated within the primary tensile system of trabeculae with a peak magnitude 4.3 times that present during gait. While the distribution of stress for the osteoporotic femur was similar to the normal, the magnitude of peak stress was increased by between 33\% and 45\%. These data call into question several assumptions which serve as the basis for theories on the pathomechanics of osteoporosis. In addition, we expect that the insight provided by this analysis will result in the improved development and interpretation of non-invasive techniques for the quantification of in vivo hip fracture risk.},

Compressive strength demonstrated a high positive correlation with both densities, being proportional to the apparent density raised to the 1.8 power (R2 = 0.93) and equivalent mineral density to the 1.5 power (R2 = 0.89). Similarly, the compressive modulus demonstrated a high correlation with both density measures, being proportional to the apparent density raised to the 1.4 power (R2 = 0.91) and CT equivalent mineral density to the 1.2 power (R2 = 0.90). Though variations in architecture and bone marrow fat were observed to influence trabecular properties, the data presented here demonstrate that apparent density, compressive strength, and elastic modulus can be determined accurately using single energy quantitative CT. We expect that the use of these noninvasive data will result in improved estimates of that component of hip fracture risk that is attributable to bone strength.},

	abstract = {We used a three-point bending test to investigate the structural behavior of 123 rectangular flat plate specimens harvested from the metaphyseal shell of the cervical and intertrochanteric regions of five fresh/frozen human proximal femora. For comparison purposes, 36 specimens of similar geometry were also fabricated from bone of the femoral diaphysis. All specimens were oriented in either the local longitudinal or transverse directions. The mean longitudinal elastic modulus was 9650 +/- 2410 (SD) MPa and demonstrated a 24\% decrease from that measured for the diaphysis (12500 +/- 2140 MPa) using the same testing technique. However, the transverse elastic moduli did not differ significantly between the proximal (5470 +/- 1720 MPa) and diaphyseal (5990 +/- 1520 MPa) specimens. The globally averaged values for the ultimate tensile strengths of the metaphyseal shell were 101 +/- 26 MPa in the longitudinal and 50 +/- 12 MPa in the transverse directions. These compared with diaphyseal values of 128 +/- 16 MPa and 47 +/- 12 MPa, respectively. While these differences were largely due to the reduced density of the proximal specimens, a slight decrease in transverse anisotropy for the proximal specimens was also noted by comparing the ratio of longitudinal to transverse moduli (1.76) and tensile strength (2.02) to the diaphyseal values (2.09 and 2.71, respectively). Use of these data should lead to improved performance of analytical models for the proximal femur, and thus help focus increased attention on the structural contribution of trabecular bone to the strength and rigidity of the proximal femur.},

	abstract = {We conducted an in vitro investigation of the loads and energies needed to fracture the proximal part of the femur in twelve fresh cadavera under loading conditions simulating one particular type of fall. The fracture loads ranged from 778 to 4,040 newtons and the work to fracture, from five to fifty-one joules. We also investigated the relationship between the fracture loads and several potential indices of bone strength, which were measured non-invasively at the subcapital, basic-cervical, and intertrochanteric regions with quantitative computed tomography. A very high positive correlation with the fracture load resulted from use of an intertrochanteric index–the product of the average trabecular computed-tomography number and the total cross-sectional area of the bone (R2 = 0.93, standard error of estimate = 295 newtons, and p less than 0.00001). We expect the use of this parameter to result in improved assessments of the degree of osteoporosis and of the component of risk of fracture of the hip that is associated with bone strength. However, the measured work to fracture for the isolated femur was an order of magnitude smaller than estimates of the energy available during a typical fall (about 450 joules), suggesting that energy absorbed during falling and impact, rather than bone strength, may be the dominant factors in the biomechanics of fracture of the hip.},

	abstract = {In vitro pre-clinical tests of hip prostheses have not yet been developed to the extent that inferior prostheses can be 'screened-out' prior to animal or clinical trials. This paper reports the experimental part of a project to develop a pre-clinical testing platform for cemented femoral hip implants. It is based on the clinical observation (Karrholm et al. JBJS, 76B (1994) 912-916) that higher subsidence (distal migration) correlates with early revision of hip prostheses. A protocol to measure the relative movement between implant and bone was designed to test whether or not such a measurement, if made in a laboratory, could discriminate between hip prostheses. The protocol was applied to the Lubinus SPII prosthesis (W. Link, Germany) and a Muller Curved Stem (JRI Ltd., UK)-these prostheses were chosen because they are known to have different loosening rates in vivo. Five prostheses of each design were tested. The migration, the rate-of-migration, and the inducible displacement of each prosthesis was recorded over two million cycles of loading.For each implant, rapid initial migration was found, followed by a period of steady-state migration. In the majority of cases, the prostheses migrated medially, distally and posteriorly. On average, the Lubinus migrated less than the Muller in all directions. The average Lubinus migration was less than half that of the Muller, and this difference was significant at a level of p=0.05. Inducible displacement was greater for the Muller compared to the Lubinus. Furthermore, the inducible displacement decreased over time for the majority of Lubinus prostheses whereas it increased over time for the majority of the Muller prostheses leading to the conclusion that a rapid pre-clinical test based on measurement of inducible displacement may be possible.},

	abstract = {Both creep and crack growth contribute to the reduction in modulus associated with fatigue loading in bone. Here we simulate crack growth and subsequent strut failure in fatigue in an open-cell, three-dimensional Voronoi structure which is similar to that of low density, osteoporotic bone. The model indicates that sequential failure of struts leads to a precipitous drop in modulus: the failure of 1\% of the struts leads to about a 10\% decrease in modulus. A parametric study is performed to assess the influence of normalized stress range, relative density, initial crack size, crack shape and cell geometry on the fatigue life. The fatigue life is most sensitive to the relative density and the initial crack length. The results lead to a quantitative expression for the fatigue life associated with crack growth. Data for the fatigue life of trabecular bone are compared with the crack growth model described in this paper as well as with a previous model for creep of a three-dimensional Voronoi structure. In our models, creep dominates the fatigue behavior in low cycle fatigue while crack growth dominates in high cycle fatigue, consistent with previous observations on cortical bone. The large scatter in the trabecular bone fatigue data make it impossible to identify a transition between creep dominated fatigue and crack growth dominated fatigue. The parametric study of the crack growth model indicates that variations in relative density among specimens, initial crack size within trabeculae and crack shape could easily produce such variability in the test results.},

Journal of Mechanical Physics of Solids 42, 1575-1599]. This solid is subject to combined cyclic axial and bending loads at its end. The objectives of the study are: (1) to verify the accuracy of the simplifying hypotheses underlying the analytical solutions established by the above authors; (2) to provide further insight into the behaviour of that solid; (3) to test the advantages in generality and versatility and the computing costs of general-purpose finite element codes in poroelastic analysis. The study is parametric with respect to the fluid leakage coefficient, to the ratio of the bending moment and axial load, and to the ratio of the characteristic relaxation time of the pore pressure over the excitation period. Results show that, for all the cases considered, the pore pressure distribution along the section height of the poroelastic beam exhibits a very good matching with previous analytical results. Stresses transversal with respect to the beam axis (assumed as constant or zero in previous analytical solutions) are evaluated. The analysis pointed out that: (1) the effects due to end-loads with zero resultants practically extinguish within a distance from the beam end almost equal to a typical length of the cross-section; (2) cross-sections remain plane above that distance; (3) the transversal total stresses are three orders of magnitude lower than axial stress.},

	volume = {53 Suppl 1},

	abstract = {There is a general, age-related reduction in the material strength and stiffness of bone in both men and women. Between the ages of 35 and 70, cortical bone strength in bending is diminished by about 15-20\%, and cancellous bone strength in compression is reduced about 50\%. In addition, bone becomes increasingly brittle and fractures with less energy. It is hypothesized that this tendency is driven by the need for remodeling to repair fatigue damage, and the fact that most osteonal and endotrabecular remodeling events fail to replace all the bone that they remove. Each remodeling event also introduces cement line interfaces, which although affording protection against fatigue failure, weaken bone for monotonic loading. Remodeling also affects collagen fiber orientation, mineralization, and the amount of unrepaired fatigue damage, which are additional determinants of bone strength and stiffness. Mechanical factors apparently inhibit age-related bone loss where stresses are higher by reducing remodeling rates and/or the deficit at each remodeling site. They may also stimulate modeling responses, primarily in the form of periosteal bone formation, which, in men more than women, alter bone size and shape to effectively compensate for loss of material strength. Suggested directions for future research include elucidation of the relationships between (1) histologically observable microcracks and bone fragility, (2) remodeling and the repair of fatigue damage, and (3) estrogen and other hormones and mechanically adaptive responses.},

	abstract = {Mechanical tests of bone provide valuable information about material and structural properties important for understanding bone pathology in both clinical and research settings, but no previous studies have produced applicable non-invasive, quantitative estimates of bending stiffness. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) data to accurately compute the bending stiffness of bone. Normal rabbit humeri (N=8) were scanned at their mid-diaphyses using pQCT. The average bone mineral densities and the cross-sectional moments of inertia were computed from the pQCT cross-sections. Bending stiffness was determined as a function of the elastic modulus of compact bone (based on the local bone mineral density), cross-sectional moment of inertia, and simulated quasistatic strain rate. The actual bending stiffness of the bones was determined using four-point bending tests. Comparison of the bending stiffness estimated from the pQCT data and the mechanical bending stiffness revealed excellent correlation (R2=0.96). The bending stiffness from the pQCT data was on average 103\% of that obtained from the four-point bending tests. The results indicate that pQCT data can be used to accurately determine the bending stiffness of normal bone. Possible applications include temporal quantification of fracture healing and risk management of osteoporosis or other bone pathologies.},

Information extraction was limited to the flexion-extension function of ankle, knee, and hip during quasi-planar motor tasks. Starting from plausible first approximation kinematics, other kinematic functions are iteratively generated by an optimization algorithm and corresponding ground reaction loads are calculated through inverse dynamics. Kinematic coordinates are represented using B-splines and modified by manipulating the control points. The iterative procedure stops and provides the final kinematic and kinetic estimates when a similarity criterion between estimated and measured ground reaction components is satisfied. The model structure was elaborated upon and the algorithm parameters optimized for robustness and accuracy using a benchmark motion in a simulation exercise. The maximal root mean square difference over time between estimated and benchmark quantities was approximately 1\% of the peak to peak value for ground reaction components and intersegmental couples, and 6\% for joint angles.},

We also conducted uniaxial compression tests to failure of the vertebral bodies after removal of the posterior elements, and found that vertebral compressive strength was also correlated at a high level of significance (R2 = 0.82, p less than 0.0001) with direct measurement of the trabecular apparent density. These findings suggested the possibility that the quantitative computed-tomography values might be directly predictive of vertebral compressive strength. However, when we correlated the quantitative computed-tomography values directly with vertebral compressive strength, the results (R2 = 0.46, p less than 0.061) were suggestive but not quite significant. All vertebral bodies failed by compression of the end-plate, suggesting only a modest structural role for the cortical shell under these loading conditions. This was confirmed by comparing the compressive load to failure of twenty additional pairs of vertebrae that were tested with and without an intact vertebral cortex. Removal of the cortex was associated with approximately 10 per cent reduction in vertebral load to failure.},

Analyses were conducted among 3,445 patients and were replicated across 24 subgroups differing in sociodemographic characteristics, diagnosis, and disease severity. For each scale, item-completion rates were high across all groups (88\% to 95\%), but tended to be somewhat lower among the elderly, those with less than a high school education, and those in poverty. On average, surveys were complete enough to compute scales scores for more than 96\% of the sample. Across patient groups, all scales passed tests for item-internal consistency (97\% passed) and item-discriminant validity (92\% passed). Reliability coefficients ranged from a low of 0.65 to a high of 0.94 across scales (median = 0.85) and varied somewhat across patient subgroups. Floor effects were negligible except for the two role disability scales. Noteworthy ceiling effects were observed for both role disability scales and the social functioning scale.

	abstract = {Subchondral stiffening is a hallmark pathologic feature of osteoarthritis but its mechanical and temporal relationship to the initiation or the progression of osteoarthritis is not established. The mechanical effect of subchondral stiffening on the surrounding trabecular bone is poorly understood. This study employs a relatively new application of digital image correlation to measure strain in the trabecular region of the proximal medial tibia in normal specimens and in specimens with simulated subchondral bone stiffening. Coronal sections from eight normal human cadaveric proximal tibiae were loaded in static compression and high resolution contact radiographs were made. Repeat contact radiographs were collected after the subchondral bone near the jointline was stiffened using polymethylmethacrylate. Digital images, made from loaded and unloaded contact radiographs, were compared using in-house software to measure trabecular displacement and calculate trabecular bone strain. Overall strain was higher in the stiffened specimens suggesting experimental artifiact significantly affected our results. Consistent increases in median maximum shear strain, median maximum principal strain, median minimum principal strain, and peak shear strain were measured near the inner and outer edges of the stiffened segment. Our experiment provides direct experimental measurement of increases in trabecular bone strain caused by subchondral stiffening, however, the clinical and biologic importance of strain increases is unknown.},

	abstract = {An improved method for manufacturing prosthetic bones is examined. We are developing a new improved method for designing and manufacturing prosthetic bones that have a porous interior core covered by a solid outer shell, more closely matching the morphology of natural bone. The new method is compatible with a wide variety of materials, including polymers, metals, composites, and biodegradable scaffold materials. Use of biodegradable scaffold material holds the potential for eventual bone regeneration within and throughout the prosthesis. Regardless of the material selection, this improved type of prosthesis is expected to more closely mimic the overall material and structural properties of natural bone, including shape, strength, weight, and weight distribution. By fabricating prosthetic bones that duplicate the material and structural properties of natural bone, implants could be made to operate as precision replacements, feeling and functioning exactly like natural bone. In addition to improving patient comfort, these new prostheses are expected to reduce the occurrence of unnatural secondary wear patterns caused by current style prosthetic bones that function in unnatural fashions due to their non-matching material and structural properties.},

	abstract = {This clinical study is the first to quantitatively evaluate both regional bone structure by computed tomography preoperatively and dental implant stability by resonance frequency analysis at the time of surgery to explore the relation between local bone structure and dental implant stability in humans. Implant stability at the time of installation is often difficult to achieve in lower density bone and implant stability might influence treatment efficacy. Few clinical studies have reported detailed bone characteristics obtained using computed tomography prior to surgery and comprehensive implant stability measurements at the time of surgery. We hypothesized that thicker cortical bone would improve the stability of the dental implant at the time of placement. Before radiographic examination, diagnostic radiographic templates were made by incorporating radiopaque indicators. Computed tomography scans were obtained for 50 edentulous subjects prior to surgery. Preoperatively, the thickness of the cortical bone at the sites of implant insertion was measured digitally, and then implant insertion surgery was performed. A total of 225-implant stability measurements were made using a resonance frequency analyzer. There was a strong linear correlation between cortical bone thickness and resonance frequency (r = 0.84, P {\textless} 0.0001). The implant length had a weak negative correlation with stability (r = -0.25, P {\textless} 0.0005). These results suggest that the initial stability at the time of implant installation is influenced more by cortical bone thickness than by implant length. The cortical and cancellous ratio of local bone is extremely important for implant stability at the time of surgery and determining the local bone condition is critical for treatment success.},

The bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) of three proximal femoral sites (neck, greater trochanter, and total) were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and the peak external joint moments at the hip during walking and jogging were calculated from gait analyses of 31 normal human subjects ranging in age from 30 to 49 years (18 females, 13 males). Various multiple regression analyses were performed to determine how much of the variance in BMD and BMC was explained by height, body mass, and the peak hip joint moments. In total, the models explained up to 40\% of the variance in BMD and 58\% of the variance in BMC. Inclusion of height or body mass did not increase the explanatory power of the models for BMD and explained no more than 8\% of the total variance in BMC once the joint moments from walking were allowed to enter the models. These data support the hypothesis that variance in peak bone mass is associated with variance in dynamic hip loads largely independent of the effect of static factors such as height and body mass.},

In this study, we measured the residual strain (corresponding to the translation of the stress-strain loops) in fatigue tests on bovine trabecular bone and compared it to an upper bound estimate of the creep strain in each test. Our results indicate that the contribution of creep to the translation of the stress-strain loops is negligible in bovine trabecular bone. These results, combined with models for fatigue in lower density bone, suggest that that creep does not contribute to the fatigue of normal human bone. Creep may make a significant contribution to fatigue in low-density osteoporotic bone in which trabeculae have resorbed, reducing the connectivity of the trabecular structure.},

	abstract = {Study of the behavior of trabecular bone at strains below 0.40 percent is of clinical and biomechanical importance. The goal of this work was to characterize, with respect to anatomic site, loading mode, and apparent density, the subtle concave downward stress-strain nonlinearity, that has been observed recently for trabecular bone at these strains. Using protocols designed to minimize end-artifacts, 155 cylindrical cores from human vertebrae, proximal tibiae, proximal femora, and bovine proximal tibiae were mechanically tested to yield at 0.50 percent strain per second in tension or compression. The nonlinearity was quantified by the reduction in tangent modulus at 0.20 percent and 0.40 percent strain as compared to the initial modulus. For the pooled data, the mean +/- SD percentage reduction in tangent modulus at 0.20 percent strain was 9.07+/- 3.24 percent in compression and 13.8 +/- 4.79 percent in tension. At 0.40 percent strain, these values were 23.5 +/- 5.71 and 35.7+/- 7.10 percent, respectively. The magnitude of the nonlineari't depended on both anatomic site (p {\textless} 0.001) and loading mode (p {\textless} 0.001), and in tension was positively correlated with density. Calculated values of elastic modulus and yield properties depended on the strain range chosen to define modulus via a linear curve fit (p {\textless} 0.005). Mean percent differences in 0.20 percent offset yield strains were as large as 10.65 percent for some human sites. These results establish that trabecular bone exhibits nonlinearity at low strains, and that this behavior can confound intersite comparisons of mechanical properties. A nonlinear characterization of the small strain behavior of trabecular bone was introduced to characterize the initial stress-strain behavior more thoroughly.},

	abstract = {Whole lumbar vertebral sections (L2 and L3) were obtained from 30 elderly individuals aged 43-95 years, mean 81 years (13 females, 17 males). None of the subjects had had malignant diseases. Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) was performed on an EMI 7070 scanner. One 8 mm slice parallel to the end-plates was obtained from the center of each vertebral body. The trabecular bone mass in each slice was outlined interactively by means of a tracer-ball. A CT-histogram was recorded inside this area, and average CT-values were expressed in Hounsfield Units (HU). The whole vertebral body (L2) was compressed in a materials testing machine. From the central part of L3, vertical cylindrical pure trabecular bone specimens were obtained. The biomechanical competence of these specimens was also assessed by means of a materials testing machine. Finally, all bone specimens were incinerated for determination of apparent ash-density. Highly significant positive correlations were found between average CT-values and (a) stress values of the trabecular bone (r = 0.81, p less than 0.001) and (b) ash-density of the pure trabecular bone (r = 0.81, p less than 0.001). Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was found between CT-values and (a) total vertebral body load (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001), (b) total vertebral body stress (load/cross-sectional area) (r = 0.55, p less than 0.001) and (c) ash-density of the whole vertebral body (r = 0.76, p less than 0.001).

A vertically oriented load applied unilaterally to the tibial component was found to generally cause the largest magnitude peak stresses within the various components of the structure. The addition of steel reinforcement to tibial components without central fixation post is predicted to significantly reduce stress levels within the polymethylmethacrylate and underlying cancellous bone. Although to a lesser extent, the addition of a relatively short central fixation post to the steel reinforced tibial component further reduced these stress levels. The longer steel central fixation post can appreciably reduce proximal cement and bone stress levels.

	abstract = {Strategies to engineer bone have focused on the use of natural or synthetic degradable materials as scaffolds for cell transplantation or as substrates to guide bone regeneration. The basic requirements of the scaffold material are biocompatibility, degradability, mechanical integrity, and osteoconductivity. A major design problem is satisfying each of these requirements with a single scaffold material. This study addresses this problem by describing an approach to combine the biocompatibility and degradability of a polymer scaffold with the osteoconductivity and mechanical reinforcement of a bonelike mineral film. We report the nucleation and growth of a continuous carbonated apatite mineral on the interior pore surfaces of a porous, degradable polymer scaffold via a one step, room temperature incubation process. A 3-dimensional, porous scaffold of the copolymer 85:15 poly(lactide-co-glycolide) was fabricated by a solvent casting, particulate leaching process. Fourier transform IR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis after different incubation times in a simulated body fluid (SBF) demonstrate the growth of a continuous bonelike apatite layer within the pores of the polymer scaffold. Quantification of phosphate on the scaffold displays the growth and development of the mineral film over time with an incorporation of 0.43 mg of phosphate (equivalent to 0.76 mg of hydroxyapatite) per scaffold after 14 days in SBF. The compressive moduli of polymer scaffolds increased fivefold with formation of a mineral film after a 16-day incubation time as compared to control scaffolds. In summary, this biomimetic treatment provides a simple, one step, room temperature method for surface functionalization and subsequent mineral nucleation and growth on biodegradable polymer scaffolds for tissue engineering.},

The average normalized peak stress in dysplastic hips (7.1 kPa/N) was markedly higher (to approximately 100\%) than the average normalized peak stress in normal hips (3.5 kPa/N). The characteristic parameters that contributed to higher peak stress in dysplastic hips included the smaller lateral coverage of the femoral head, the larger interhip distance, the wider pelvis, and the medial position of the greater trochanter. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that stress distribution over weight-bearing surface of the hip joint is the relevant parameter for assessment of the risk for developing coxarthrosis.},

The review focused on the perioperative complications of nerve or tendon lacerations, intraoperative fractures, acute deep infections, wound complications and component positioning. Major wound complications were defined as those requiring a soft-tissue coverage procedure. Minor wound complications did not require soft tissue coverage and included wound breakdowns, wound edge necrosis, and superficial infections. The immediate mortise and lateral postoperative radiographs were reviewed to measure component positioning. The patients were divided into two groups to compare the initial 25 patients (Group A) with the subsequent 25 patients (Group B). There were no major wound complications in either group. Minor wound complications decreased from six in Group A to two in Group B. There were four lacerations (flexor hallucis longus, posterior tibial tendon, deep peroneal nerve, and superficial peroneal nerve), all occurring in Group A. Five patients sustained intraoperative fractures in Group A, as compared with two fractures in Group B. The number of components varying greater than 4 degrees from neutral as measured by the lateral talar, lateral tibial and mortise tibial component angles decreased by 9\% from Group A to Group B. The only tibial component to be placed in more than 4 degrees of valgus occurred in Group A. It seems that a notable learning curve exists in the performance of total ankle arthroplasty as demonstrated by a comparison of the initial 25 patients with the subsequent 25 patients performed by one orthopaedic surgeon. This improvement most likely resulted from the use of enhanced techniques and further training with the prosthesis. This information can be used as a teaching tool to decrease the incidence of complications for surgeons performing their initial arthroplasties with this potentially technically demanding procedure.},

	abstract = {Dislocation remains a disturbingly frequent complication of total hip arthroplasty (THA). Over the past several years, increasingly rigorous biomechanical approaches have been developed for studying dislocation, both experimentally and computationally. Realism of the input motion challenge data has lagged behind most other aspects of this body of work, and anterior dislocation maneuvers remain unstudied. To enhance realism of biomechanical studies of dislocation, motion data are here reported for ten THA-aged subjects, each repeatedly performing seven maneuvers known to be dislocation-prone. An optoelectronic motion tracking system and a recessed force plate captured the kinematics and ground reaction forces of these maneuvers. Using an established inverse dynamics model to estimate hip joint loading, 354 motion trials were evaluated using an existing finite element model of THA dislocation. Worst-case-scenario THA constructs were simulated (22 mm femoral head, acetabular cup orientations at the limit of the accepted safe zone), in order to deliberately induce impingement and dislocation. The results showed a high incidence of computationally predicted dislocation for all movements studied, but also that risk was very maneuver-dependent, with patients being six times more likely to dislocate from a low-sit-to-stand maneuver than from stooping. These new motion data hopefully will help facilitate systematic efforts to reduce the incidence of dislocation.},

	abstract = {Time-dependent loading of trabecular bone consists of both cyclic and sustained static loads. Numerous studies have investigated the effects of fatigue and creep loading on the apparent and damage behavior of bone; however, microdamage formation in trabecular bone under stress relaxation tests has not been characterized. Bovine trabecular bone specimens (1.5-3 years old) were loaded in uniaxial compression to 0.9\% strain and held for six different time points: 0Â s, 250Â s, 2000Â s, 5000Â s, 10,800Â s, and 36,000Â s. Total microdamage increased with hold time and leveled off after 10,800Â s. The qualitative patterns of microdamage progressed from surface damage for short hold times to microcracks extending through the trabecular thickness as hold time increased. Residual strain behavior corresponded well with microdamage formation over time. These results indicate that under static compressive deformation, microdamage accumulation leads to the development of residual strains with time. This mechanism has important implications on reloading of specimens where degradations in bone strength may contribute to age-related skeletal fragility and traumatic fractures.},

It is thought that reduced femoral stress from alterations in load transfer caused by an intramedullary stem contributes to proximal femoral atrophy. An increase in flexural rigidity and bone stress near the stem tip is thought to contribute to thigh pain. A three-dimensional finite element analysis study was performed to calculate stresses in the proximal femur and bone near the stem tip before and after implantation of a collared, proximally coated, cementless femoral prosthesis. The influence of prosthetic material was examined by changing implant composition from cobalt chrome to titanium alloy and leaving all other parameters constant. Femoral stress was increased twofold immediately below the collar with the titanium implant compared with the cobalt chrome. However, the proximal femoral stress in the titanium implanted model was still 1/10 that in the corresponding region of the unimplanted femur model. At the stem tip, as much as a 30\% reduction in femoral stress was seen with the titanium stem compared with the cobalt chrome. These findings suggest biomechanical evidence of an advantage for titanium as an implant material compared with cobalt chrome for cementless femoral stems.},

First, when the load was applied dynamically, the stresses were between 1 and 20\% different than when it acted quasi-statically.

One hundred sixty-one knees had either one or two stems placed. One hundred eight femoral stems and 76 tibial stems were placed. Fifty-five knees had no femoral or tibial stem. The average knee scores ranged from 52 preoperatively to 86 postoperatively. The average range of motion postoperatively was 4 degrees (range, 0 degrees -10 degrees ) to 106 degrees (range, 94 degrees -118 degrees ) in this group. The average postoperative knee score was 86 in the unstemmed group and 85 in the stemmed group with no difference in average range of motion. There were four (3\%) cases of tibial loosening and two (2\%) cases of femoral loosening in the unstemmed group. There were two (2\%) cases of tibial loosening and two (2\%) cases of femoral loosening at an average followup of 4.2 years (range, 2-6.2 years). Despite the higher constraint inherently designed in an Insall-Burstein constrained condylar knee component, the current study did not show a significantly higher loosening in implants without stems compared with implants used with stems. Therefore, the use of a semiconstrained component does not alone constitute a requirement for the use of an intramedullary stem.},

To evaluate this interface further, we obtained biopsy specimens from the proximal part of the femur at the time of removal of trochanteric wires from four patients eleven to twenty-seven months after revision hip arthroplasty with cement and impaction grafting. Three relatively ill defined zones were identified histologically: an inner zone consisting of bone cement, fibrous tissue, and partially necrotic trabeculae with evidence of bone-remodeling; a middle zone consisting of viable trabecular bone and probable formation of so-called neocortex with fewer particles of bone cement; and an outer zone consisting of viable cortex. Fibrous tissue was present around some of the incorporating fragments of bone graft, but no continuous fibrous membrane was seen. Particles of cement were identified, but no polyethylene debris was visible on examination with light microscopy. The results demonstrated remodeling of bone and at least partial restoration of bone stock in the proximal part of the femur after revision arthroplasty with cement and impaction grafting.},

	abstract = {The ability to predict trabecular failure using microstructure-based computational models would greatly facilitate study of trabecular structure-function relations, multiaxial strength, and tissue remodeling. We hypothesized that high-resolution finite element models of trabecular bone that include cortical-like strength asymmetry at the tissue level, could predict apparent level failure of trabecular bone for multiple loading modes. A bilinear constitutive model with asymmetric tissue yield strains in tension and compression was applied to simulate failure in high-resolution finite element models of seven bovine tibial specimens. Tissue modulus was reduced by 95\% when tissue principal strains exceeded the tissue yield strains. Linear models were first calibrated for effective tissue modulus against specimen-specific experimental measures of apparent modulus, producing effective tissue moduli of (mean+/-S.D.) 18.7+/-3.4GPa. Next, a parameter study was performed on a single specimen to estimate the tissue level tensile and compressive yield strains. These values, 0.60\% strain in tension and 1.01\% strain in compression, were then used in non-linear analyses of all seven specimens to predict failure for apparent tensile, compressive, and shear loading. When compared to apparent yield properties previously measured for the same type of bone, the model predictions of both the stresses and strains at failure were not statistically different for any loading case (p{\textgreater}0.15). Use of symmetric tissue strengths could not match the experimental data. These findings establish that, once effective tissue modulus is calibrated and uniform but asymmetric tissue failure strains are used, the resulting models can capture the apparent strength behavior to an outstanding level of accuracy. As such, these computational models have reached a level of fidelity that qualifies them as surrogates for destructive mechanical testing of real specimens.},

	abstract = {The convergence behavior of finite element models depends on the size of elements used, the element polynomial order, and on the complexity of the applied loads. For high-resolution models of trabecular bone, changes in architecture and density may also be important. The goal of this study was to investigate the influence of these factors on the convergence behavior of high-resolution models of trabecular bone. Two human vertebral and two bovine tibial trabecular bone specimens were modeled at four resolutions ranging from 20 to 80 microns and subjected to both compressive and shear loading. Results indicated that convergence behavior depended on both loading mode (axial versus shear) and volume fraction of the specimen. Compared to the 20 microns resolution, the differences in apparent Young's modulus at 40 microns resolution were less than 5 percent for all specimens, and for apparent shear modulus were less than 7 percent. By contrast, differences at 80 microns resolution in apparent modulus were up to 41 percent, depending on the specimen tested and loading mode. Overall, differences in apparent properties were always less than 10 percent when the ratio of mean trabecular thickness to element size was greater than four. Use of higher order elements did not improve the results. Tissue level parameters such as maximum principal strain did not converge. Tissue level strains converged when considered relative to a threshold value, but only if the strains were evaluated at Gauss points rather than element centroids. These findings indicate that good convergence can be obtained with this modeling technique, although element size should be chosen based on factors such as loading mode, mean trabecular thickness, and the particular output parameter of interest.},

However, the determinants of satisfactory press-fit are not well understood. In previous studies, human cortical bone loaded circumferentially to simulate press-fit exhibited viscoelastic, or time dependent, behavior. The effect of bone viscoelastic behavior on the initial stability of press-fit stems is not known. Therefore, in the current study, push-out loads of cylindrical stems press-fit into reamed cadaver diaphyseal femoral specimens were measured immediately after assembly and 24 h with stem-bone diametral interference and stem surface treatment as independent variables. It was hypothesized that stem-bone interference would result in a viscoelastic response of bone that would decrease push-out load thereby impairing initial press-fit stability. Results showed that push-out load significantly decreased over a 24 h period due to bone viscoelasticity. It was also found that high and low push-out loads occurred at relatively small amounts of stem-bone interference, but a relationship between stem-bone interference and push-out load could not be determined due to variability among specimens. On the basis of this model, it was concluded that press-fit fixation can occur at relatively low levels of diametral interference and that stem-bone interference elicits viscoelastic response that reduces stem stability over time. From a clinical perspective, these results suggest that there could be large variations in initial press-fit fixation among patients.},

Full bony ingrowth has been associated with greater stress shielding than partial ingrowth; therefore, the effect of intimate bonding of the stem to bone on subsequent bone loss was also studied. A damage- and disuse-based remodeling theory was coupled with a two-dimensional finite element model of the tibia to predict changes in bone remodeling following long stemmed total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for four different fixation techniques (cement, press-fit, interlock with bony ingrowth, and interlock without bony ingrowth). Remodeling changes commenced with the model state variables–bone area fraction, mechanical stimulus, damage, and remodeling activity–at steady-state values predicted by the intact tibia simulation. After TKA and irrespective of fixation technique, the model predicted elevated remodeling due to disuse, in which more bone was removed than replenished. In regions below the tibial tray and along the cortices, the interlocking stem with full bony ingrowth and the cemented stem caused the least amount of bone loss. An interlocking stem with a smooth, matted finish did not reduce the bone loss associated with interlocking fixation.},

Specimens were taken from bovine tibiae and fatigue tested in cyclic compression at a stress range of 80 MPa. The specimens were stained before testing with alizarin and up to three other chelating agents were applied during testing to label microcracks formed at different times. Microcracks initiated in interstitial bone in the early part of a specimen's life. Further accumulation of microcracks is then suppressed until the period late in the specimen's life. Microcracks were found to be longer in the longitudinal than in the transverse direction. Only a small proportion of cracks are actively propagating; these are longer than non-propagating cracks. These results support the concept of a microstructural barrier effect existing in bone, whereby cracks initiate easily but slow down or stop at barriers such as cement lines.},

Oil was forced through the vertebral bodies under various volumetric flow rates and the resultant pressure was measured The pressure-flow relationship for each specimen was linear. Therefore, HR was constant with a mean of 2.22 +/- 1.45 kPa*sec/ml. The mean permeability of the intact vertebral bodies was 4.90x10(-10) +/- 4.45x10(-10) m2. These results indicate that this methodology is valid for whole bone samples and enables the exploration of the effects of HR on the creation of high-speed fractures.},

	abstract = {In order to determine the accuracy of measurements of Young's modulus of cancellous bone by conventional compression testing, two independent strain measurements were made simultaneously during non-destructive uniaxial compression to 0.8\% strain of rectangular specimens (n = 18). Strain was measured by an extensometer attached to the compression anvils close to the specimen and by an optical system covering the central half of the specimens. Mean Young's modulus determined by the extensometer technique was 689 MPa, but was 871 MPa when determined by the optical technique (mean difference = 182 MPa, SED = 50 MPa, p less than 0.002). Uneven strain distribution due to lack of support of cut vertical trabeculae at the anvil-specimen interface is believed to be causing the underestimation of Young's modulus measured by the extensometer technique. The influence of friction at the specimen-anvil interface was studied by performing a finite element analysis. It is concluded that Young's modulus of specimens of the chosen geometry on average is underestimated by about 20\% by conventional compressing testing. The underestimation seems not to be dependent upon specimen density.},

	abstract = {Computer simulations of bone remodeling in response to mechanical stresses can be used to understand normal growth and development of the skeleton or to predict the remodeling of bone in response to prosthetic devices. Using a previously derived bone maintenance theory, a technique for computing bone density distributions was applied to the proximal femur and tibia using two-dimensional, multiple-loading finite element models. The models initially represented solid, homogeneous structures. Using an iterative bone remodeling technique that relates bone apparent density to loading history, the internal distributions of apparent density and elastic modulus for the normal bones were predicted. The finite element models were then modified to represent bones in which porous-coated femoral surface replacements and tibial tray components had been implanted. The same iterative remodeling method was then applied to predict the distribution of bone around these components. The predicted bone density distributions for the natural femur and tibia agree with previously documented normal bone morphology. The predicted bone density distributions around various implanted prostheses were characteristic of the component under investigation and were consistent with clinical and experimental findings of other investigators. In the femoral head, stress shielding occurred underneath the metal surface replacement cup, resulting in lower densities in the femoral head. The addition of a central femoral cup fixation peg caused bone hypertrophy around the peg. In the tibia, the stress concentrations around the pegs also resulted in denser bone, with a concomitant decrease in bone density at more peripheral locations underneath the prosthetic tray. This remodeling technique has the potential to be an important tool in predicting the possible remodeling consequences of new implant design features.},

The anteroposterior (AP) tibial alignment angle was measured. The canal-filling ratio (CFR) was determined by dividing the stem diameter by the endosteal diameter at the stem tip. Overall, the ability to achieve tibial alignment in the AP plane was more predictable when canal-filling (CFR {\textgreater}/= 0.85) cementless stems were used. This was further enhanced when long canal-filling cementless stems were selected. The least-predictable results and the highest probability of varus malalignment were achieved with cemented stems.},

Depth dependent changes in the parameters were observed for the first 6 mm of the cores in normal knees: BV/TV, Tb.N and Conn.D gradually decrease, while Tb.Sp and SMI increase. In the first 6 mm of the normal tibia BV/TV, Tb.N, and Tb.Th are greater than in the femur on both the medial and lateral compartments while Tb.Sp, SMI, and Conn.D are lower. The medial compartment values for BV/TV, Tb.N, Tb.Th and Conn.D are generally greater than for the lateral in both the femur and tibia while Tb.Sp and SMI are lower. In comparison of normal vs. arthritic knees significant differences are observed in the first 6 mm of the medial tibia. With arthritis BV/TV and Tb.Th are lower, while SMI and Tb.Sp are higher. Tb.N and Conn.D show no statistically significant difference. The bone structure variations are, thus, most prominent in the first 6 mm of depth and medial compartment bone is generally more structurally sound than lateral. Severely arthritic bone changes are most prominent in the medial compartment of the tibia and bone structure is less sound in severe arthritis.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional, quantitative computed tomography based finite element model of a proximal implanted tibia was analysed in order to assess the effect of mesh density on material property discretisation and the resulting influence on the predicted stress distribution. The mesh was refined on the contact surfaces (matched meshes) with element sizes of 3, 2, 1.4, 1 and 0.8 mm. The same loading conditions were used in all models (bi-condylar load: 60\% medial, 40\% lateral).Significant variations were observed in the modulus distributions between the coarsest and finest mesh densities. Poor discretisation of the material properties also resulted in poor correlations of the stresses and risk ratios between the coarsest and finest meshes. Little difference in Young's modulus, von Mises stress and risk ratio distributions were observed between the three finest models; hence, it was concluded that for this particular case an element size of 1.4 mm on the contact surfaces was enough to properly describe the stiffness, stress and risk ratio distributions within the bone. Poor convergence of the material property distribution occurred when the element size was significantly larger than the pixel size of the source CT data. It was concluded that unless there is convergence in the Young's modulus distribution, convergence of the stress field or of other parameters of interest will not occur either.},

The reason for revision was aseptic loosening of 1 or both components in 32 knees (56\%), instability in 16 knees (28\%), polyethylene wear and osteolysis in 4 knees (7\%), supracondylar femur fracture in 2 knees (4\%), and a failed allograft, pain, and arthrofibrosis in 1 knee each (5\% total). The average age of the patients at the time of the revision was 74 years (range, 38-90), and the original diagnosis for the majority of patients was osteoarthritis (74\%). All of the revision prostheses were cemented posterior stabilized or constrained condylar-type implants. Bone deficiencies were grafted with cancellous allograft in contained defects and cortical allograft in noncontained defects. Five knees were reconstructed with allograft-prosthesis composites. The average modified Hospital for Special Surgery knee score improved from 49 to 82 (100 points possible) at final follow-up evaluation (P {\textless} 0.001). Seventy-nine percent of knees were graded as good or excellent. Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis predicted 94\%+/-6.2\% survival at 40 months and 75\%+/-25\% at 99 months. There were 4 clinical failures, 3 of which were related to residual instability in patients with a posterior-stabilized prosthesis. Complications (3 knees) were exclusively related to the extensor mechanism. Radiographically, overall knee alignment improved from 0.3 degrees varus to 3.0 degrees valgus. Fifty-six percent of tibial components were placed in slight varus alignment. Radiolucent lines occurred in 33\% of knees, but there were no complete or progressive radiolucencies. Radiolucent lines were more prevalent adjacent to press-fit intramedullary femoral stems compared with cemented stems (P {\textless} .02), but the difference did not correlate with clinical or radiographic failure. The median bone defect score, as proposed by the Knee Society Committee on Bone Defects, was significantly greater in knees that were revisions of a failed cemented total knee arthroplasty compared with revision of a failed cementless total knee arthroplasty (P = .02) but was not correlated with clinical or radiographic outcome (P {\textgreater} .05).},

	abstract = {Large joint implants must have immediate fixation to be successful. Unfortunately, the magnitude and consistency of achieving this remains largely unknown. For cementless femoral components it is being increasingly appreciated that torsional loading as occurs during stair climbing or rising from a chair leads to loosening and thigh pain in some cases. A biomechanical test was developed to evaluate fixation in this position. Twelve pairs of human cadaveric femora were press-fit with an AML stem. Each femur was secured in a horizontal position, and the prosthetic head cyclically loaded in a vertically downward direction. The offset of the prosthetic head resulted in a combined torsional and compressive load being applied to the stem within the proximal femur. Loosening was found to consistently occur and rapidly accelerate when the head subsided more than 0.2 mm during 100 cycles. For the AML stem, loosening developed at loads from 62 to 171\% of body weight and after as few as 800 cycles. This is within the physiologic range of normal daily activities as measured by others with instrumented prostheses. This poses a challenge to the ability of press-fit stems to tolerate torsional loads in vivo. Patients with a cementless prosthesis should be protected from torsional loading until porous ingrowth and/or bone remodelling have had time to occur. Testing the same stem in paired femora demonstrated no right vs left difference (p greater than 0.6).},

Prosthetic knee kinematics were determined by integration of dynamic equations of motion subject to forces generated by muscles, ligaments, and contact at both the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral articulations. The modeling of contacts between implants did not rely upon explicit constraint equations; thus, changes in the number of contact points were allowed without modification to the model formulation. The simulation reproduced experimentally measured flexion-extension angle of the knee (within one standard deviation), but translations at the tibiofemoral articulations were larger during the simulated step-up task than those reported for patients with total knee replacements.},

Osteoblasts are sensitive to mechanical stimuli, so to study the bone-implant interface it would be important to quantify their reaction in a situation mimicking the mechanical situation arising at that interface. In this study, we present the development of a new device allowing the application of micromotions and load on cells in vitro. The new device allowed the cells to be stimulated with sinusoidal motions of amplitudes comprised between +/- 5 and +/- 50 microm, frequencies between 0.5 and 2 Hz, and loads between 50 and 1000 Pa. The device, with a total length of 20 cm, was designed to work in an incubator at 37 degrees C and 100\% humidity. Expression of various bone important genes was monitored by real-time RT-PCR. Micromotions and load were shown to affect the behavior of osteoblasts by down-regulating the expression of genes necessary for the creation of organic extracellular matrix (collagen type I) as well as for genes involved in the mineralization process (osteocalcin, osteonectin). The developed device could then be used to simulate different mechanical situations at the bone-implant interface.},

	abstract = {Micro-finite element (microFE) models based on high-resolution images have enabled the calculation of elastic properties of trabecular bone in vitro. Recently, techniques have been developed to image trabecular bone structure in vivo, albeit at a lesser resolution. The present work studies the usefulness of such in-vivo images for microFE analyses, by comparing their microFE results to those of models based on high-resolution micro-CT (microCT) images. Fifteen specimens obtained from human femoral heads were imaged first with a 3D-pQCT scanner at 165 microns resolution and a second time with a microCT scanner at 56 microns resolution. A third set of images with a resolution of 165 microns was created by downscaling the microCT measurements. The microFE models were created directly from these images. Orthotropic elastic properties and the average tissue von Mises stress of the specimens were calculated from six FE-analyses per specimen. The results of the 165 microns models were compared to those of the 56 microns model, which was taken as the reference model. The results calculated from the pQCT-based models, correlated excellent with those calculated from the reference model for both moduli (R2 {\textgreater} 0.95) and for the average tissue von Mises stress (R2 {\textgreater} 0.83). Results calculated from the downscaled micro-CT models correlated even better with those of the reference models (R2 {\textgreater} 0.99 for the moduli and R2 {\textgreater} 0.96 for the average von Mises stress). In the case of the 3D-pQCT based models, however, the slopes of the regression lines were less than one and had to be corrected. The prediction of the Poisson's ratios was less accurate (R2 {\textgreater} 0.45 and R2 {\textgreater} 0.67) for the models based on 3D-pQCT and downscaled microCT images respectively). The fact that the results from the downscaled and original microCT images were nearly identical indicates that the need for a correction in the case of the 3D-pQCT measurements was not due to the voxel size of the images but due to a higher noise level and a lower contrast in these images, in combination with the application of a filtering procedure at 165 micron images. In summary: the results of microFE models based on in-vivo images of the 3D-pQCT can closely resemble those obtained from microFE models based on higher resolution microCT system.},

	abstract = {This study used radiography, gait analysis, gluteal muscle mass, mechanical testing, and qualitative histology to compare three methods of gluteal muscle attachment to an allograft/endoprosthetic composite of the proximal 25\% of the femur in an in vivo canine model. The three methods of gluteal muscle attachment were identical to those used clinically in human patients for hip revision and proximal femoral limb salvage: the host gluteal tendon sutured to the allograft tendon (tendon group), the host greater trochanter with intact gluteal tendons secured to the allograft with a cable-grip system (grip group), and periosteally vascularized proximal femoral bone onlay with intact tendons wrapped around the allograft (wrap group). On the basis of radiographs taken every 2 months, the tendon group had more graft fractures than did the grip or wrap group. Radiographic union of the graft-host bone junction occurred more rapidly and there was less graft resorption in the wrap group than in the other two groups. In all dogs, peak vertical ground-reaction forces in the treated limb decreased immediately after surgery and then slowly increased over the length of the study. The dogs in the wrap group regained normal weight-bearing on the treated limb more quickly than did those in the other groups. The constructs in the tendon group were weaker and less stiff immediately after surgery than were those in the other groups or in intact controls. Histologic analysis confirmed that the wrap technique resulted in complete union of the host bone-allograft junction more often than did the other techniques. The wrap method had the best functional outcome after 9 months when an allograft/endoprosthetic composite was used during total hip arthroplasty in this canine model.},

	abstract = {Trabecular bone structure may complement bone volume/total volume fraction (BV/TV) in the prediction of the mechanical properties. Nonetheless, the direct in vivo use of information pertaining to trabecular bone structure necessitates some predictive analytical model linking structure measures to mechanical properties. In this context, the purpose of this study was to combine BV/TV and topological parameters so as to better estimate the mechanical properties of trabecular bone. Thirteen trabecular bone mid-sagittal sections were imaged by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at the resolution of 117 x 117x 300 microm(3). Topological parameters were evaluated in applying the 3D-line skeleton graph analysis (LSGA) technique to the binary MR images. The same images were used to estimate the elastic moduli by finite element analysis (FEA). In addition to the mid-sagittal section, two cylindrical samples were cored from each vertebra along vertical and horizontal directions. Monotonic compression tests were applied to these samples to measure both vertical and horizontal ultimate stresses. BV/TV was found as a strong predictor of the mechanical properties, accounting for 89-94\% of the variability of the elastic moduli and for 69-86\% of the variability of the ultimate stresses. Topological parameters and BV/TV were combined following two analytical formulations, based on: (1) the normalization of the topological parameters; and on (2) an exponential fit-model. The normalized parameters accounted for 96-98\% of the variability of the elastic moduli, and the exponential model accounted for 80-95\% of the variability of the ultimate stresses. Such formulations could potentially be used to increase the prediction of the mechanical properties of trabecular bone.},

It is shown that the method applied to bone and soft tissue has allowed researchers to predict the deformations of musculoskeletal structures and to explore biophysical stimuli within tissues at the cellular level. Next, the contribution of finite element modelling to the scientific understanding of joint replacement is reviewed. Finally, it is shown that, by incorporating finite element models into iterative computer procedures, adaptive biological processes can be simulated opening an exciting field of research by allowing scientists to test proposed 'rules' or 'algorithms' for tissue growth, adaptation and degeneration. These algorithms have been used to explore the mechanical basis of processes such as bone remodelling, fracture healing and osteoporosis. RELEVANCE: With faster computers and more reliable software, computer simulation is becoming an important tool of orthopaedic research. Future research programmes will use computer simulation to reduce the reliance on animal experimentation, and to complement clinical trials.},

	abstract = {We evaluated the intermediate-term results of a novel total ankle arthroplasty that includes insertion of the components without cement and arthrodesis of the tibiofibular syndesmosis as part of the operative procedure. One hundred consecutive Agility ankle replacements were performed in ninety-five patients between 1984 and 1993. At the time of follow-up, eighty-three patients (eighty-six ankles) were alive and twelve patients (fourteen ankles) had died. Five (6 per cent) of the eighty-six ankles in the living patients had been revised. Including the components that had been revised for loosening, twenty-one (twelve tibial and nine talar) components had migrated. Delayed union of the syndesmosis (twenty-eight ankles) and non-union of the syndesmosis (nine ankles) were associated with the development of lysis around the tibial component. Non-union of the syndesmosis was also associated with migration of the tibial component and circumferential radiolucency around that component. In addition to the patients who died, one patient had a resection of the implant with subsequent arthrodesis. The remaining eighty-two patients (eighty-five ankles) were the basis for the clinical evaluation in the study. The average age at the time of the procedure was sixty-three years (range, twenty-seven to eighty-one years). At the time of the most recent follow-up (range, 2.8 to 12.3 years; average, 4.8 years), forty-seven (55 per cent) of the remaining eighty-five ankles were not painful and twenty-four (28 per cent) were only mildly painful. The range of motion of the fifty-six ankles that were examined at the time of follow-up averaged 36 degrees (range, 10 to 64 degrees), and the results for seventy-nine (93 per cent) of the eighty-five ankles were satisfactory to the patients.},

Life table analysis reveals a 94.1\% clinical survivorship at 15 years, with an 90.9\% survivorship when roentgenographic failures are included. There were five revisions: one for infection, one for instability, and three for tibial loosening. In addition, two tibiae and one patella were considered roentgenographically loose, but were not symptomatic. As of May 1992, 34 patients with 48 knees are known deceased, 15 knees are lost to follow-up evaluation, and 49 knees are available for clinical evaluation. Follow-up data was available on 62 knees for greater than 11 years. Ninety-two percent had good or excellent results, with 1.6\% fair and 6.5\% poor. Average range of motion was 99 degrees. The average Hospital for Special Surgery knee score was 85. Roentgenographic study revealed lucencies around 72\% of tibiae, but only two components were loose. There was a correlation between body weight and the presence of radiolucencies, and patients who weighed more than 80 kg had the lowest survivorship at 15 years: 89.2\% clinical survival and 70.6\% clinical plus roentgenographic survival.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Failure of total knee arthroplasty is problematic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the factors that influence the durability of a primary total knee prosthesis. METHODS: A survivorship analysis of 11,606 primary total knee arthroplasties carried out between January 1, 1978, and December 31, 2000, was performed. An analysis of patient and implant-related factors affecting survivorship was done with use of a multivariate Cox model. RESULTS: The survivorship was 91\% (95\% confidence interval, 90\% to 91\%) at ten years (2943 knees), 84\% (95\% confidence interval, 82\% to 86\%) at fifteen years (595 knees), and 78\% (95\% confidence interval, 74\% to 81\%) at twenty years (104 knees) following the surgery. Prosthetic survivorship at ten years was 83\% for patients fifty-five years of age or less compared with 94\% for those older than seventy years of age (p {\textless} 0.0001), 90\% for those with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis compared with 95\% for those with inflammatory arthritis (p {\textless} 0.005), and 91\% for those with retention of the posterior cruciate ligament compared with 76\% for those with substitution of the posterior cruciate ligament (a posterior stabilized prosthesis) (p {\textless} 0.0001). Survivorship at ten years was 92\% for nonmodular metal-backed tibial components, 90\% for modular metal-backed tibial components, and 97\% for all-polyethylene tibial components (p {\textless} 0.0001). Survivorship at ten years was 92\% for prostheses fixed with cement compared with 61\% for those fixed without cement (p {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Significant risk factors for failure of total knee arthroplasty were the type of implant, age and gender of the patient, diagnosis, type of fixation, and design of the patellar component. In the ideal situation-treatment of a woman over the age of seventy years who has inflammatory arthritis with a nonmodular, metal-backed tibial component, cement fixation, an all-polyethylene patellar component, and retention of the posterior cruciate ligament-the ten-year survivorship of the prosthesis was estimated to be 98\% (95\% confidence interval, 97\% to 99\%).},

	volume = {29},
	abstract = {Based upon magnetic resonance scans of five human tibiae a three-dimensional finite element model using eight nodal isoparametric elements was developed to analyze the biomechanical properties of fracture fixation by an unreamed interlocking nail. Tension phenomena and bone implant translations occurring in the borderlines of the fracture zone, bone-implant interface, and the fixation site of the interlocking screws were analyzed with the help of link elements. The proximal fracture segment was fixed with a link element so as to produce exclusively translatory shifts corresponding to the vector of the load applied. Under condition of static load F = 500 N or axial torsion MT = 15 Nm the biomechanical properties of a nailed horizontal fracture (42-A3), a three fragment lesion (42-B2), and a comminuted midshaft fracture (42-C3) were evaluated. On condition of axial load maximum dislocations of 0.1549 mm are induced in the direction of the x-axis due to the asymmetric geometry of the human tibia which promotes medially directed translations. Independent from the fracture type present a homogenous tension profile was calculated for the whole tibia diaphysis with a sigmaEQV ranging from 24.18 to 121.14 MPa due to the relative low elastic modulus of the cortical bone compared to material characteristics of the implant. However, application of a torsional moment MT = 15 Nm induces significantly increased tension maxima in the nail-interlocking screw interface with a sigmaEQV = 7, 626 MPa. Maximum translatory movements ux = 12.59 mm and uy = 23.53 mm in the x and y plane indicate that these load conditions bear a high risk of an implant failure.},

The ultimate goal of this work is to develop numerical models that allow the surgeon to estimate the primary stability during the pre-operative planning session. The present study was aimed to validate finite-element (FE) models accounting for patient and prosthetic size and position as planned by the surgeon. For this purpose, the FE model of a cadaveric femur was generated starting from the CT scan and the anatomical position of a cementless stem derived by a skilled surgeon using a pre-operative CT-based planning simulation software. In-vitro experimental measurements were used as benchmark problem to validate the bone-implant relative micromotions predicted by the patient-specific FE model. A maximum torque in internal rotation of 11.4 Nm was applied to the proximal part of the hip stem. The error on the maximum predicted micromotion was 12\% of the peak micromotion measured experimentally. The average error over the entire range of applied torques was only 7\% of peak measurement. Hence, the present study confirms that it is possible to accurately predict the level of primary stability achieved for cementless stems using numerical models that account for patient specificity and surgical variability.},

Strain readings were also taken around the central pegs. The variables of the tibial components were all-plastic versus a metal tray; short, medium, and long post; and complete versus incomplete upper surface coverage. For varus-valgus or anteroposterior loading, there were high strains due to bending around the proximal part of the plastic stem compared with the metal stem; the metal stem carried a much higher bending moment than did the plastic stem. In direct loading, there was a rim of low-stressed bone around the proximal perimeter for incomplete contact, and a metal stem longer than the standard, transmitted some load directly to the cortex; a plastic stem carried only small axial loads, probably because of its low axial stiffness. Metal backing is not without disadvantages; notably, some load by-passing, cost, and comparatively difficult removal.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a statistical analysis of the pooled data from a number of previous experiments concerning the dependence of the Young's moduli and strength of cancellous bone tissue upon apparent density. The results show that both the Young's moduli and the strength are proportional to the square of apparent density of the tissue and are therefore proportional to one another. It is shown that the coefficient of proportionality is different for human and bovine tissue. It is concluded that the suggestion of Wolff (Das Gesetz der Transformation der Knochen, Hirschwald, Berlin, 1892) that compact bone tissue is simply more dense cancellous bone tissue is not an accurate statement when only the mechanical properties of these two tissues are considered. It is noted that estimates for the elastic modulus of the individual trabecula of human cancellous bone vary from 1 to 20 GPa and it is suggested that this question needs further study.},

	title = {Clinical experiences with three different designs of ankle prostheses},
	volume = {7},
	url = {#},
	abstract = {Until 1995, fusion was in our institution the only rational surgical option for a severe ankle arthrosis. Consistent reports about good mid- and long-term results with ankle replacement allowed us to change our minds. Ankle replacement became the gold standard and fusion was then almost totally banished. Because ankle arthrosis can be morphologically different from one patient to another, we soon believed that one single type of ankle prosthesis would not be the universal optimal solution for all patients. We therefore divided the ankle arthrosis into three groups. Each group shows the best solution from each of the ankle prostheses with which we had gained experience (Agility, STAR, and BP). The Agility prosthesis, which was indicated for ankles with extremely damaged geometry, did not restore sufficiently the ankle motion. Preoperatively stiff ankles remained stiff postoperatively. Additionally, significant residual pain was more likely to occur in those patients. These cases did not show significant advantages compared with ankle fusion, especially from a functional point of view. Fusion for these stiff ankles is therefore today our first treatment of choice. In our experience, the malleolar joints do not have to be replaced. Even a severe arthrosis at this level does not produce significant pain, provided that osteophytes have been removed and joint height has been restored by the implanted prosthesis. It is our strong belief that these malleolar joints are also less sensitive to pain, similar to the femoropatellar joint. For these reasons, a replacement of the malleolar joints and the resurfacing of the talar sides is not necessary. Leaving the talar sides untouched requires less bone resection and makes the implantation of the talar component easier. Although we obtained good results with the STAR prosthesis, we progressively abandoned it because of these reasons, and we preferred the BP prosthesis. The BP prosthesis works on the same biomechanic principle as the STAR prosthesis. Some features, however, like the untouched malleolar joints, the large exposition of the joint, the easier adjustments of its position, the possibility of enhancing the press fit, and the good short- and midterm results we obtained with it led us to the decision of using it as our only design for cases of nice and acceptable arthroses. Even if mostly good and excellent results have been achieved with all prostheses currently used, some results are still disappointing. Some ankles become stiff postoperatively and some remain diffusely painful; the explanations for these problems are often difficult to attain. This clearly shows that despite all the progress made over the last few years, there is still a lot to be learned about ankle arthroplasty.},

The correlations between the various parameters are analysed. A positive linear correlation between the four parameters compressive stength, limit of elasticity, modulus of elasticity and apparent density could not be excluded. The material properties vary considerably both within one single bone and between individuals. Compressive strength, modulus of elasticity and apparent density found for cancellous bone of the femoral head are greater than those found in the condyles. Within the condyles, compressive strength, elastic modulus and apparent density increase from the proximal parts to the parts closer to the joint. The medial femoral condyle showed higher compressive strength than the lateral one. Relating each of the three other parameters to the apparent density of the individual specimen did not result in equalizing the data for the material properties.

They were classified as "low-vBMD" (LD-ROI, with a vBMD of 200-400 mg/cm(3)), corresponding chiefly to trabecular-subcortical bone; "medium-vBMD" (MD-ROI, vBMD = 400-800 mg/cm(3)), corresponding mainly to porous cortical bone or cortical-subcortical bone, and "high-vBMD" (HD-ROI, vBMD higher than 800 mg/cm(3)), corresponding to dense cortical bone. The fraction of the total cross-sectional bone area covered by the HD-ROI was 16\% higher, and that covered by the MD-ROI 20\% lower, in pre-MP than post-MP women. No differences concerning the LDROIs were found. A close, linearly negative relationship was found between the MD- and HD-ROI fractions in all the women together, with no inter-group differences in slope. The Stress-Strain Index (an indicator of the torsional stiffness and strength of the whole bones that involved both the vBMD and the spatial disposition of the HD bone in the cross-section - torsional moment of inertia -) correlated linearly and positively with the cross-sectional area of the HD-ROI, with a higher slope for pre-MP than post-MP women. Qualitatively, a. post-MP women showed a significantly more prevalent discontinuity of the voxels in the HD-ROI than pre-MP women, and b. the tendency of LD-ROIs to accumulate along the mechanically lesseffective (antero-posterior) axis of the image - a characteristic of pre-MP bones - was visually less evident in post-MP bones. These features describe non-invasively some changes induced by menopause in the human tibia that may be critical for defining the skeletal condition and to monitor the effects of treatments addressed either to protect or to improve mechanically the bone structure, beyond the possibilities of standard densitometry.},

An X-ray tube with a microfocus is used as a source, a CCD-array as a detector. Samples with diameters from a few millimeters to a maximum of 14 mm can be measured, typically, bone biopsies with a diameter of 8 mm and a length of approximately 10 mm are measured. Spatial resolution is 28 microns. Usually the volume of interest contains 4 x 4 x 4 mm3 and is represented in 14 x 14 x 14 microns3 voxels. 3D stereological indices are extracted according to the standard definitions used in histomorphometry. Triangular surface representation is effected with an extended marching cube algorithm and forms a convenient basis for finite element analysis. Microtomographic measurements may be employed to "calibrate" lower-dose, lower-resolution images in vivo as well as to nondestructively assess unprocessed surgical bone biopsy specimens.

Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) is a radiographic system of unique accuracy which has applications in areas where minute motions or no motion at all occurs. Examples are micromotion between endoprostheses and bone and in fracture healing. We have determined the accuracy of the RSA system as applied to a clinical series of spinal fusions, where the conditions for RSA were not optimal. Using the usual test-retest methodology on a phantom, we showed that its accuracy can be grossly overestimated in the individual case. We found considerable variations in the accuracy in the individual case, depending on the rigid-body configuration. The overall accuracy, expressed as 3-D "vectors" for rotation and translation, respectively, correlated with the condition number, a method for characterizing the marker configuration. Indeed, the condition number explained as much as 92\% of the variation in overall rotation. This condition number, however, cannot be used to analyze the accuracy of one degree of freedom of rotation alone. Mathematical simulation of the accuracy in the individual case of the individual dimension, using in-house software, showed that the accuracy (95\% confidence) varied between 0.4 and 4.6 degrees of rotation about the transverse axis, corresponding to a clinical stress series of extension and flexion.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: TNFalpha and IL-1alpha are proinflammatory cytokines that are abundant in periprosthetic tissues. These cytokines stimulate bone resorption and have recently been shown to directly induce osteoclast formation in mouse marrow cultures. We examined whether TNFalpha and IL-1alpha can directly induce osteoclast formation from human arthroplasty-derived (CD14(+)) macrophages by a mechanism independent of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. METHODS: TNFalpha and M-CSF (+/-IL-1alpha) were added to cultures of magnetically sorted (CD14(+)) and unsorted (CD14(+)/CD14(-)) cells isolated from the pseudomembrane of loosened hip arthroplasties. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), RANK:Fc and antibodies to TNF receptors (p55 and p75) were added to these cultures to distinguish the pathway of osteoclastogenesis. Osteoclast differentiation was assessed by expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), vitronectin receptor (VNR) and lacunar resorption. RESULTS: The addition of TNFalpha (+/-IL-1alpha) resulted in differentiation of CD14(+) macrophages into TRAP(+) and VNR(+) multinucleated cells capable of extensive lacunar resorption. Both OPG and RANK:Fc (which inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis) did not block osteoclastogenesis. The addition of antibodies directed against the p55 receptor subunit of TNF resulted in significant inhibition of osteoclast formation and lacunar resorption. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that, in the presence of M-CSF, TNFalpha is sufficient for inducing human osteoclast differentiation from arthroplasty macrophages and that TNFalpha acts synergistically with IL-1alpha to stimulate lacunar resorption. This process is distinct from the RANK/RANKL signalling pathway and is likely to operate in periprosthetic tissues when there is heavy wear particle deposition and cytokine production.},

	abstract = {The significance of torsional loads on the tibial component of total knee replacement prostheses is not clearly established. This study investigated the micromotion induced by torsion, under physiologic loads. Three forms of fixation were sequentially tested in cadaveric tibiae: press-fit, press-fit plus 4 peripheral corticocancellous screws, and horizontally cemented. The implanted tibia was loaded with an axial force between 0.5 and 2.2 kN and a cyclic torque of +/- 5 Nm. The relative motion between the prosthesis and the bone was measured. Our results show little difference between the 3 methods of fixation at high axial loads. At low axial loads, however, the press-fit prosthesis may permit micromotions high enough to interfere (theoretically) with bone ingrowth. Motion is reduced when the same prosthesis is augmented with screws. The cemented prosthesis produces the lowest average micromotion. Our study indicates that rotational micromotion is unlikely to contribute to the failure of ingrowth into the uncemented tibial prosthesis under normal physiologic loads. At low axial loads, which may be encountered in the immediate postoperative period, ingrowth may be compromised. Thus, initial rotational stability is an important consideration in uncemented total knee replacement design and postoperative management. In poor-quality tibiae, cementation may be the only method of fixation to provide sufficient torsional stability. (J Arthroplasty 1999 Aug;14(5):610-5)},

The surgical procedure must be done in a precise manner, with selection of the proper size of prosthesis and accurate insertion of the components in all directions. Proper tensioning of the joint is also paramount to achieve long-term stability. The precise degree of tensioning is still somewhat controversial, although with experience the deltoid end point can be readily determined in most patients.

	volume = {86-A},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although current designs of cemented femoral stems for total hip replacement include both those with and those without a flanged shape at the proximal end, the influence of anteroposterior dorsal flanges on the fixation of the stem is not completely understood. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of flanges on femoral stem stability and load transfer to the femur with use of an in vitro model. METHODS: We measured femoral surface strains and three-dimensional micromotion in synthetic femora under cyclic loading with four types of stems: those with flanges and those without flanges in two sizes each. The four types of stems were otherwise identical; that is, all of them were straight, polished, and collarless. Stem-cement micromotion measurements and strain measurements were repeated with three stems of each type, whereas bone-cement micromotion measurements were made with one stem of each type. RESULTS: Flanges had a greater influence on femoral strains and micromotion than did the difference in the cement thickness resulting from the different stem sizes. Specifically, the flanged stems produced greater strains on the medial femoral surface but smaller strains on the anterior surface than did the non-flanged stems. Flanged stems achieved tighter mechanical interlock within the cement, but these stems increased bone-cement micromotion. Specifically, the motion per cycle of flanged stems within the cement mantle was smaller than that of non-flanged stems, whereas the motion per cycle of the cement mantle within the femoral canal was greater with the flanged stems than with the non-flanged stems. CONCLUSIONS: Flanges on a total hip femoral stem increase the interlock between the stem and the cement and decrease the proximal-medial stress-shielding. However, these advantages occur with increased bone-cement interface motion, which may be detrimental to the survival of the implant.},

	volume = {16},
	abstract = {Two designs of total knee replacements were analysed to determine how the geometry of their bearing surface would affect the susceptibility of their ultra high molecular weight polyethylene tibial inserts to delamination. Orientations of the femoral components on the tibial surfaces were calculated with use of rigid body analysis for discrete intervals during the stance phase of gait. For each successive orientation, finite element analysis was used to compress the components together to determine the stresses in the tibial inserts. A damage function analogous to strain energy density was defined to account for the accumulated amplitudes and frequencies of the maximum shear stress cycles and hence to predict fatigue failure. The damage function was applied to each polyethylene element in the tibial insert, and the highest value calculated for each design was its damage score. One knee had a damage score more than three times less than that of the other because of lower stresses and because the contact points moved in the medial-lateral as well as anterior-posterior directions during internal-external rotation. The femoral and tibial components of this knee had large outer frontal radii and close conformity in the frontal plane. We propose that this method, which accounts for the motions and stresses endured during walking, makes different predictions regarding the likelihood of delamination compared with the predictions made by conventional static compression tests performed when the knee is in a neutral position.},

	abstract = {Aseptic loosening and failure of a tibial component are recognized problems in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Excessive stress on the supporting cancellous bone is thought to contribute to the loosening and failure. Of factors that could influence supporting cancellous bone stresses, we focused on the inclination of a unicompartmental tibial component by analyzing the effect of coronal plane and sagittal plane inclination. Detailed geometrically accurate, three-dimensional finite element models were constructed from computed tomography (CT) data of a typical adult male proximal tibia. The material properties for the models were obtained directly from the CT data to simulate the inhomogeneous distribution of cancellous bone properties. Placing the component in slight valgus inclination in the coronal plane reduced the cancellous bone stresses. Posterior inclination in the sagittal plane caused a moderate increase in the stresses. Our results suggest that slight valgus inclination of a UKA tibial component may be preferable to varus or square inclination in the coronal plane. An excessive posterior slope of a tibial component should be avoided.},

Microdamage in loaded and nonloaded control specimens was then assessed histomorphometrically. Fatigue, evidence by stiffness loss, was observed at both strain rates and was significantly greater in specimens loaded at the high experimental strain rate than in specimens loaded at the low strain rate. Morphologically, this fatigue corresponded to increased numbers of microcracks in the bone. These data show that fatigue and resultant microdamage are realistic expectations of cyclic loading within the physiological strain range. The rate at which strains are developed influences the fatigue behavior of compact bone, suggesting that cyclic loading at high physiological strain rates, characteristic of vigorous activities, is more damaging to compact bone than loading at lower physiological strain rates.},

For solution of the FTP an algorithm is suggested which is conceptually similar to algorithms previously developed by the authors for the ZTP. Finally, the VTP is solved by a double-iterative algorithm in which the inner iteration is performed by the FTP- algorithm. The application of the algorithm is demonstrated by means of relatively simple numerical examples. Basic properties, such as convergence properties, are displayed based on the examples.},

To investigate the geometrical and biomechanical aspects of pre-operative planning we created a set of programs to automatically perform a simulation of intertrochanteric osteotomies on a three-dimensional finite element model of the human proximal femur based on computed tomography (CT) data and using uniform brick-shaped elements. To eliminate artefacts resulting from the rough surface of the brick elements, the femoral head was represented by a tetrahedron-based head that included a cartilage layer and a subchondral cortical zone. Applicability of the procedure was tested by performing a parametric study using a model created from CT scans taken in vivo, by applying individually calculated force conditions for the one-leg stance situation. We found a large influence of osteotomy angle on the observed stress in the femoral head cartilage, especially in a situation with insufficient containment of the femoral head. The model presented here is a biomechanical tool to simulate intertrochanteric osteotomies patient-specifically for a better understanding of the effects of such operations in the individual case. The open design of the described programs allows future interfacing with surgical navigation and robot systems.},

Two hundred twelve surgeries were done on 203 patients (nine patients had bilateral surgeries). The reasons for failure listed in order of prevalence among the patients in this study include polyethylene wear, aseptic loosening, instability, infection, arthrofibrosis, malalignment or malposition, deficient extensor mechanism, avascular necrosis in the patella, periprosthetic fracture, and isolated patellar resurfacing. The cases reviewed included patients who had revision surgery within 9 days to 28 years (average, 3.7 years) after the previous surgery. More than half of the revisions in this group of patients were done less than 2 years after the index operation. Fifty percent of early revision total knee arthroplasties in this series were related to instability, malalignment or malposition, and failure of fixation.},

	abstract = {The goal of this study was to calculate and explain the pattern of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) loading during normal level walking. Knee-ligament forces were obtained by a two-step procedure. First, a three-dimensional (3D) model of the whole body was used together with dynamic optimization theory to calculate body-segmental motions, ground reaction forces, and leg-muscle forces for one cycle of gait. Joint angles, ground reaction forces, and muscle forces obtained from the gait simulation were then input into a musculoskeletal model of the lower limb that incorporated a 3D model of the knee. The relative positions of the femur, tibia, and patella and the forces induced in the knee ligaments were found by solving a static equilibrium problem at each instant during the simulated gait cycle. The model simulation predicted that the ACL bears load throughout stance. Peak force in the ACL (303 N) occurred at the beginning of single-leg stance (i.e., contralateral toe off). The pattern of ACL force was explained by the shear forces acting at the knee. The balance of muscle forces, ground reaction forces, and joint contact forces applied to the leg determined the magnitude and direction of the total shear force acting at the knee. The ACL was loaded whenever the total shear force pointed anteriorly. In early stance, the anterior shear force from the patellar tendon dominated the total shear force applied to the leg, and so maximum force was transmitted to the ACL at this time. ACL force was small in late stance because the anterior shear forces supplied by the patellar tendon, gastrocnemius, and tibiofemoral contact were nearly balanced by the posterior component of the ground reaction.},

Displacement between the tibial tray and the proximal tibia was measured with linear variable differential transformers at the anterior and posterior side when anteriorly or posteriorly loaded, and at the medial and lateral side when medially or laterally loaded. The general pattern of motion was sinking at the loaded side and lift-off at the opposite side. Lift-off opposite the loaded side was fairly small for all components at all measurement sites. Among the three components, the Whiteside showed the smallest displacements. The Tricon (when anteriorly or posteriorly loaded), and the PCA (when medially or laterally loaded) showed sinking at the loaded side. Anterior screw fixation of the PCA was not effective in preventing anterior lift-off. The tilting motion of the tibial components observed in this study implies instability of the initial fixation, which could possibly compromise bony ingrowth. Furthermore, this tilting could cause uneven distribution of load, and potentially result in fracture of the underlying bone.},

	abstract = {An apparatus was developed to measure load-displacement friction properties at the cancellous bone/porous-coated metal plate interface. Bone cubes were obtained from different proximal regions of four resurfaced cadaveric tibiae. Three different porous-surfaced metal plates (one fiber mesh and two bead) and a smooth-surface metal plate were used. In the presence of a constant normal contact pressure (0.10, 0.15, or 0.25 MPa), a variable tangential load up to the maximum resistance of the interface was applied and both relative normal and tangential displacements were recorded. Repetitive and fatigue loadings were also considered. Measured results show that the interface friction curve is highly nonlinear, exhibiting large relative tangential displacements in the range of 50-400 microns before the maximum load is reached. Relative displacements in the normal direction remain below 10 microns. The maximum resistance in friction is independent of the bone excision site, type of porous-surfaced metal plate, magnitude of normal load, placement of bone cubes on metal plates or vice versa, repetition of applied load, and conservation period of bone cubes in saline solution. The smooth-surfaced metal plate has significantly smaller friction resistance than porous-coated ones. The fatigue loading of up to 4000 cycles at 1 Hz, in the presence of 0.25 MPa contact pressure, slightly decreases the interface friction coefficient. Finally, the initial secant stiffness of the interface at 75\% of the maximum resistance load is found to be larger for the bone cubes from the lateral and medial regions and for the metal plate with smooth surface.},

	abstract = {Many cementless implant designs rely upon a diaphyseal press-fit in conjunction with a porous coated implant surface to achieve primary or short term fixation, thereby constraining interface micromotion to such a level that bone ingrowth and consequent secondary or long-term fixation, i.e., osseointegration, can occur. Bone viscoelasticity, however, has been found to affect stem primary stability by reducing push-out load. In this investigation, an axisymmetric finite element model of a cylindrical stem and diaphyseal cortical bone section was created in order to parametrically evaluate the effect of bone viscoelasticity on stem push-out while controlling coefficient of friction (mu = 0.15, 0.40, and 1.00) and stem-bone diametral interference (delta = 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.50 mm). Based on results from a previous study, it was hypothesized that stem-bone interference (i.e., press-fit) would elicit a bone viscoelastic response which would reduce the initial fixation of the stem as measured by push-out load. Results indicate that for all examined combinations of mu and delta, bone viscoelastic behavior reduced the push-out load by a range of 2.6-82.6\% due to stress relaxation of the bone. It was found that the push-out load increased with mu for each value of delta, but minimal increases in the push-out load (2.9-4.9\%) were observed as delta was increased beyond 0.10 mm. Within the range of variables reported for this study, it was concluded that bone viscoelastic behavior, namely stress relaxation, has an asymptotic affect on stem contact pressure, which reduces stem push-out load. It was also found that higher levels of coefficient of friction are beneficial to primary fixation, and that an interference "threshold" exists beyond which no additional gains in push-out load are achieved.},

	abstract = {It is recognized that the chronic inflammation in peri-prosthetic tissue that contributes to implant failure frequently is provoked by the presence of wear debris. Some wear debris is inevitable because of the nature of the prosthesis, but not all patients develop severe inflammatory responses. The precise factors that mediate the severity of tissue inflammation to wear debris has yet to be fully defined. Because wear debris retrieved from peri-prosthetic tissue consists of a heterogeneous mixture of materials with various sizes and shapes, this study evaluated the influence of two major physical aspects of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) wear debris (shape and surface texture) using a model of tissue inflammation. UHMWPE debris particulates recovered from 50 peri-prosthetic tissue samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy and categorized into four groups based upon aspect ratio and surface texture of the material. The four groups were defined as: 1) smooth and globular, 2) smooth and fibular, 3) rough and globular, and 4) rough and fibular. Histological analysis and ELISA assays were conducted to evaluate variations in cellular responses and cytokine production between the groups. The strongest expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1 beta was found in tissues exposed to UHMWPE debris with both a rough surface texture and fibular shape, and this response was significantly elevated over debris particles with a smooth surface texture and globular shape. The data suggest that both shape and texture influence the severity of specific inflammatory responses and that rough debris surface texture exerts a marked effect on adverse tissue responses when combined with particles that have a sharp, elongated shape.},

	abstract = {Computed tomography-based finite element analysis represents a powerful research tool for investigating the mechanics of skeletal fractures. To provide evidence that this technique can be used to predict failure loads and fracture patterns for bone structures, we compared the observed and predicted failure behaviors of 18 midsagittal sections, 10 mm thick, cut from human vertebral bodies. The specimens were scanned by computed tomography, and finite element models were generated with use of empirically determined density-property relations to assign element-specific material properties. The specimens were loaded to failure in uniaxial compression, and the models were analyzed under matching conditions. The models provided predictions of yield load that were strongly correlated with experimentally measured values (r2 {\textgreater} 0.86) and were typically within 25\% of measured values. Predicted stiffness values were moderately correlated with measured values, but large absolute differences existed between them. Comparisons between regions of observed fracture and of high predicted strain indicated that strain was an accurate indicator of the pattern of local fracture in more than two-thirds of the bone specimens. In addition, strain contour plots provided better indicators of local fracture than did stress plots in these heterogeneous bone structures. We conclude that computed tomography-based finite element analysis can be used successfully to predict both global and local failure behavior of simplified skeletal structures.},

The strain distribution was measured for three loading configurations: joint reaction force only, joint reaction force plus abductors, and joint reaction force plus the abductors, vastus lateralis and iliopsoas. In each case the strains were recorded from 20 uniaxial strain gauges placed on the medial, lateral, anterior and posterior aspects of the proximal femur. Application of the abductor muscle force produced a marginal decrease in the strain levels on all aspects of the femur as compared with the joint reaction force alone. This is in contrast with previous studies which have simulated an unconstrained femoral head. The inclusion of vastus lateralis and iliopsoas further reduced the strain levels. A horizontally constrained femoral head produces smaller variation in the strain levels when muscle forces are applied. In vivo data, demonstrating negligible movement of the femoral head in one-legged stance, support the results of this study and suggest that in the absence of comprehensive muscle force data, a constrained femoral head may provide a more physiologically relevant loading condition.},

	abstract = {It has been hypothesized that a major objective of morphological adaptation in limb-bone diaphyses is the achievement of uniform regional safety factors between discrete cortical locations (e.g. between cranial and caudal cortices at mid-diaphysis). This hypothesis has been tested, and appears to be supported in the diaphyses of ovine and equine radii. The present study more rigorously examined this question using the equine third metacarpal (MC3), which has had functionally generated intracortical strains estimated by a sophisticated finite element model. Mechanical properties of multiple mid-diaphyseal specimens were evaluated in both tension and compression, allowing for testing of habitually tensed or compressed regions in their respective habitual loading mode ('strain-mode-specific' loading). Elastic modulus, and yield and ultimate strength and strain, were correlated with in vivo strain data from a previously published finite element model. Mechanical tests revealed minor variations in elastic modulus, and yield and ultimate strength in both tension and compression loading, while physiological strains varied significantly between the cortices. Contrary to the hypothesis of uniform safety factors, the MC3 has a broad range of tension (caudo-medial, 4.0; cranio-lateral, 37.7) and compression (caudo-medial, 5.7; cranio-lateral, 68.9) safety factors},

	abstract = {It is difficult to assess from conventional x-rays the amount of loading that a bone can tolerate. The question therefore was asked whether the mechanical properties of cortical bone could be estimated by using a computed tomography (CT) system typically employed in the clinical setting. In vitro cross sectional diaphyseal scans of adult human tibiae were made using a GE 9800 scanner and linear attenuation coefficients determined in several regions of the central cross sections. Samples from the mid-diaphyses of these tibiae were harvested, tested in three-point bending to failure, and mechanical properties as well as density and ash fraction determined. The respective relationships between CT measurements, mechanical properties, and physical properties were calculated using regression analysis. In addition, a solid calibration phantom (tricalciumphosphate) was scanned to evaluate the variability of CT measurements. The physical parameters measured in this study were found to be comparable with data from other authors but correlations were moderate to weak. Linear regression revealed the following correlation coefficients with CT data: r = 0.55 (Young's modulus), r = 0.50 (strength), r = 0.65 (apparent density) and r = 0.46 (ash fraction). The correlation coefficients of these regressions for both linear and power fits were not significantly different. A high linear correlation (r = 0.99) was found between the chamber densities and the measured attenuation coefficients, but accuracy varied between 2 and 6\%. The small range of specimen mechanical properties as well as the limitations inherent with the methods employed may explain these results. We conclude that clinical equipment as used in this study is not sufficient to accurately estimate the mechanical properties of cortical bone.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mobile-bearing knee designs represent an alternative to conventional fixed-bearing total knee arthroplasty. We present the results of a prospective, intermediate-term clinical follow-up study of the bicruciate ligament-sacrificing porous-coated Low Contact Stress rotating-platform total knee design. METHODS: Between February 1984 and January 1994, 528 uncemented primary knee replacements were performed in 421 patients. All patellae were resurfaced with use of the Low Contact Stress rotating patellar component. The average age of the patients at the time of the index procedure was sixty-nine years. The study group included 261 women and 160 men. Patients were evaluated at three months, six months, and yearly thereafter with use of the 100-point New Jersey Orthopaedic Hospital knee-scoring system. In addition, a radiographic analysis of the tibial, femoral, and patellar components was performed at each interval. RESULTS: There were twenty-nine failures that resulted in revision. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of implant survival at twelve years was 89.5\% (95\% confidence interval, 83.4\% to 95.6\%). The total clinical scores improved significantly compared with the preoperative scores for the first twelve months postoperatively and then plateaued. Three hundred and twenty-one knees had adequate radiographic follow-up (average, 8.1 years; range, five to twelve years). Zonal radiographic analysis revealed ninety-three instances of radiolucent lines (eighty-two of which measured {\textless}1 mm in width), with the greatest number of radiolucent lines (thirty-nine) being located around the tibial tray stem. None of these lines were deemed to be progressive, and no knee with a radiolucent line that measured {\textgreater}2 mm was revised because of failure. CONCLUSIONS: This first-generation uncemented, mobile-bearing, bicruciate ligament-sacrificing knee replacement was associated with a good survival rate and demonstrated clinical efficacy during the five to twelve-year follow-up interval. .},

Patients with ankle joint disease showed reduced motion which returned to near normal values 1 year following total ankle replacement. Compressive force across the ankle joint rose to about 5 times body weight during the latter part of stance phase.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE. Five styles of commercial static wrist extensor orthoses were compared to determine whether any style, or styles, afforded better power grip strength or finger dexterity. Because wrist extensor orthoses are intended for use during functional tasks, their influence on hand function is of great importance. METHOD. Twenty-three right-hand-dominant women without upper extremity dysfunction participated in this crossover study. Dominant-hand finger dexterity and power grip strength were evaluated while wearing each of five commercial orthoses-Kendall-Futuro \#33 (Futuro), AliMed Freedom Long (AliMed Long), AliMed Freedom Short (AliMed Short), Smith \& Nephew Rolyan D-Ring (Rolyan), and LMB Wrist Rest (LMB)–and while using the dominant hand without an orthosis (free hand). Finger dexterity was assessed with the unimanual subtest of the Purdue Pegboard. Grip strength was assessed with a Jamar hydraulic dynamometer. RESULTS. Four of the study orthoses (Futuro, AliMed Short, Rolyan, and LMB) afforded finger dexterity that did not differ significantly from that of the free hand. The AliMed Long orthosis slowed finger speed when compared with the speeds afforded by both the LMB orthosis and the free hand. The Rolyan orthosis permitted a power grip strength that was not significantly different from the free hand. The other four commercial orthoses reduced grip strength when compared with the strength observed when wearing a Rolyan orthosis and when gripping with a free hand. CONCLUSION. The five styles of commercial orthoses affect power grip and finger dexterity differently. When power grip or finger dexterity are priorities, differences among the orthoses furnish grounds for initial suggestions, although medical needs and patient preference should be the overriding factors in the final selection of an orthosis.},

Three stem configurations were compared: (1) no stem; (2) short stem (40 mm); and (3) long stem (75 mm). In addition, three loading conditions were analyzed for each stem configuration: (1) central loading; (2) posterior loading; and (3) medial loading. The longer stem implants were associated with increased micromotion, especially under eccentric loading. Cemented implants seemed to have more stable fixation, compared with noncemented implants. It was thought that the increased motion was secondary to a toggling of the implant under load, secondary to uneven medullary cortical contact. Overall, the results indicated that short and long stems do not enhance initial fixation with cemented or cementless implantation in routine knee arthroplasty.},

For that purpose, a finite element simulation is proposed that predicts damage accumulation in the cement mantle and prosthetic migration. If the simulation is to become a convincing preclinical test, it should be able to distinguish between implants in a clinically relevant way, based on accurate predictions of long-term failure mechanisms of cemented hip prostheses. The algorithm was used to simulate long-term fatigue experiments on femoral reconstructions with Mueller Curved and Lubinus SPII stems. Clinically, the Mueller Curved system performs inferior to the Lubinus SPII system. The finite element simulation predicted much more cement damage around the Mueller Curved stem and showed that the entire cement mantle was involved in the failure process, which was not the case around the Lubinus SPII stem. In addition, the Mueller Curved stem was predicted to migrate more than the Lubinus SPII. The predictions showed excellent agreement with the experimental findings: similar damage locations in the cement, more damage for the Mueller Curved, similar prosthetic migration directions, and more migration for the Mueller Curved stem. This is the first time that a finite element simulation is able to differentiate between a clinically superior and an inferior implant, based on accurate simulation of the long-term failure mechanisms in a cemented reconstruction. Its use for preclinical testing purposes is corroborated.},

	abstract = {Finite element (FE) models could be used for pre-clinical testing of cemented hip replacement implants against the damage accumulation failure scenario. To accurately predict mechanical failure, the models should accurately predict stresses and strains. This should be the case for various implants. In the current study, two FE models of composite hip reconstructions with two different implants were validated relative to experimental bone and cement strains. The objective was an overall agreement within 10\% between experimental and FE strains. Two stem types with different clinical results were analyzed: the Lubinus SPII and the Mueller Curved with loosening rates of 4\% and 16\% after 10 yr, respectively (Prognosis of total hip replacement. 63rd Annual Meeting of the American Academy of orthopaedic surgeons, Atlanta, USA). For both implant types, six stems were implanted in composite femurs. All specimens were subjected to bending. The Mueller Curved specimens were additionally subjected to torsion. Bone strains were recorded at 10 locations on the cortex and cement strains at three locations within the cement mantle. An FE model was built for both stem types and the experiments were simulated. Bone and cement strains were calculated at the experimental gauge locations. Most FE bone strains corresponded to the mean experimental strains within two standard deviations; most FE cement strains within one standard deviation. Linear regression between the FE and mean experimental strains produced slopes between 0.82 and 1.03, and R(2) values above 0.98. Particularly for the Mueller Curved, agreement improved considerably when FE strains were compared to the strains from the experimental specimen used to build the FE model. The objective of overall agreement within 10\% was achieved, indicating that both FE models were successfully validated. This prerequisite for accurately predicting long-term failure has been satisfied.},

The purpose was to determine which muscle groups should be included in pre-clinical tests, predicting bone adaptation and mechanical failure of cemented reconstructions, ensuring an adequate representation of in vivo loading of the reconstruction. Loads were applied as occurring during heel-strike, mid-stance and push-off phases of gait. The stress/strain distributions within the reconstruction, produced by the hip-joint contact force, were compared to ones produced after sequentially including the abductors, the iliotibial tract and the adductors and vastii. Inclusion of the abductors had the most pronounced effect. They neutralized lateral bending of the reconstruction at heel-strike and increased medial bending at mid-stance and push-off. Bone strains and stem stresses were changed accordingly. Peak tensile cement stresses were reduced during all gait phases by amounts up to 50\% around a bonded stem and 11\% around a debonded one. Additional inclusion of the iliotibial tract, the adductors and the vastii produced relatively small effects during all gait phases. Their most prominent effect was a slight reduction of bone strains at the level of the stem tip during heel-strike. These results suggest that a loading configuration including the hip-joint contact force and the abductor forces can adequately reproduce in vivo loading of cemented total hip reconstructions in pre-clinical tests.},

	abstract = {Peak stress levels predicted in finite element analysis (FEA) usually depend on mesh density, due to singular points in the model. In an earlier study, an FEA algorithm was developed to simulate the damage accumulation process in the cement mantle around total hip replacement (THR) implants. It allows cement crack formation to be predicted, as a function of the local cement stress levels. As the simulation is driven by mesh-dependent peak stresses, predicted crack formation rates are also likely to be mesh dependent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mesh dependence of the predicted crack formation process, and to present a method to reduce the mesh dependence. Crack-propagation experiments were simulated. Experimental specimens, representing transverse slices of cemented THR reconstructions, were subjected to cyclic torsional loading. Crack development around the corners of the stem was monitored. The experiments were simulated using three meshes with increasing levels of mesh refinement. Crack locations and orientations were accurately predicted, and were virtually independent of the level of mesh refinement. However, the experimental crack propagation rates were overestimated considerably, increasing with mesh refinement. To eliminate the effect of stress singularities around the corners of the stem, a stress averaging algorithm was applied in the simulation. This algorithm redistributed the stresses by weighted spatial averaging. When damage accumulation was computed based on averaged stresses, the crack propagation rates predicted were independent of the level of mesh refinement. The critical distance, a parameter governing the effect of the averaging algorithm, was optimized such that the predicted crack propagation rates accurately corresponded to the experimental ones. These results are important for the validity and standardization of pre-clinical testing methods for orthopaedic implants.},

The nervous system may coordinate multiple degrees of freedom (DF) by combining them in a task-specific way to control them as a unit or synergy. Some movements may be accomplished using only one synergy, whereas other movements may employ several synergies. To investigate the problem of interjoint coordination, we applied principal component (PC) analysis to eight types of movement in healthy male subjects: forward squats, backward squats, sideways squats, squats on one leg, walking three steps, stepping in place, going up a step, and going down a step. Angular changes in four DF were analyzed: thigh flexion-extension, knee flexion-extension, ankle flexion-extension, thigh abduction-adduction, with the former three DF investigated in all movements. For many movements, two synergies were sufficient to account for more than 95\% of DF angular excursions. Squatting on one leg could be described using only one synergy (99\%). The angle between the vectors representing PCs for movements produced with the right and left legs could be less than 10 degrees for some movements but could reach 25 degrees for other movements. The nervous system may thus use somewhat different interjoint coordinations while producing movements on the right and the left sides. The angle between the first PCs of different movements could be smaller than 10 degrees. Thus there may be a common but adjustable basic synergy that is used to produce different movements. Additional synergies provide the transition from one movement to another.},

	volume = {21},
	abstract = {The fracture of bone plays a key role in osteoporosis. BMD measurement, however, is only an indirect parameter of this phenomenon. We therefore developed a highly sensitive three-point bending test for the metaphyseal tibias in rats to evaluate stiffness and strength. This was validated in a right-left comparison and a bioassay with soy-free food, estradiol, raloxifene, and testosterone in orchidectomized rats. INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis becomes manifest predominantly in the metaphyseal rat tibia. The anti-osteoporotic character of substances should, therefore, be tested (mechanically) in this bone area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated a new three-point bending test for the metaphyseal tibia in rats in a right-left trial. In an animal experiment, we studied the change of bone quality under estradiol (E)-, raloxifene (R)-, and testosterone (T)-supplemented food and compared it with trabecular BMD (qCT). RESULTS: In the right-left comparison, the mean difference between the metaphyseal loads of both tibias in 37 rats was 8.43\% for the maximum load (Fmax) and 6.46\% for the failure load (fL). These results show the high reproducibility of the test, because they are close to the usual intraindividual difference of the two extremities. In a second experiment, four groups of 11 3-month-old male orchidectomized rats were fed with soy-free food only (C) or with the additives E, T, or R for 12 weeks. E and R were similar for Fmax and fL. There were significant differences in the stiffness (E = 406.92 N/mm versus R = 332.08 N/mm), the yield load (yL; E = 99.17 N versus R = 83.33 N), and the ratio between yL and Fmax (E = 86.33\% versus R = 76.37\%). T was similar to the controls concerning F(max), fL, and stiffness. There were significant differences in yL (T = 49.00N versus C = 39.5N) and the ratio between yL and Fmax (T = 64.28\% versus C = 51.28\%). CONCLUSIONS: Estradiol is superior to raloxifene concerning stiffness and yield load, and both are superior to testosterone. We conclude that the described three-point bending test for the metaphyseal tibia is a highly sensitive method to study hormones and substances with regard to their osteoprotective character. The precision and the low SD of the presented results are superior to the data from qCT and the calculated index of stiffness (SSI).},

Although the same reference phantoms were used, the QCT values varied markedly depending on the CT scanner employed. The differences in QCT values were greater in the equivalent amount of CaCO3 than in that of K2HPO4. The largest difference between CT scanners was 40 mg/cm3 in the equivalent amount of CaCO3 and 28 mg/cm3 in that of K2HPO4. These differences were reflected among CT scanners by different slopes and intercepts of the reference lines of CaCO3, K2HPO4 and ash density depending on the CT scanner used. However, good correlations (r greater than 0.97) were observed for the QCT values obtained by various CT scanners. These results show that QCT values on one machine can be compared more closely with those of another machine if conversion formulae, determined by using materials equivalent to human vertebral bone, are employed.},

	abstract = {To explore the hypothesis that load-induced fluid flow in bone is a mechano-transduction mechanism in bone adaptation, unit cell micro-mechanical techniques are used to relate the microstructure of Haversian cortical bone to its effective poroelastic properties. Computational poroelastic models are then applied to compute in vitro Haversian fluid flows in a prismatic specimen of cortical bone during harmonic bending excitations over the frequency range of 10(0) to 10(6) Hz. At each frequency considered, the steady state harmonic response of the poroelastic bone specimen is computed using complex frequency-domain finite element analysis. At the higher frequencies considered, the breakdown of Poisueille flow in Haversian canals is modeled by introduction of a complex fluid viscosity. Peak bone fluid pressures are found to increase linearly with loading frequency in proportion to peak bone stress up to frequencies of approximately 10 kHz. Haversian fluid shear stresses are found to increase linearly with excitation frequency and loading magnitude up until the breakdown of Poisueille flow. Tan delta values associated with the energy dissipated by load-induced fluid flow are also compared with values measured experimentally in a concurrent broadband spectral analysis of bone. The computational models indicate that fluid shear stresses and fluid pressures in the Haversian system could, under physiologically realistic loading, easily reach the level of a few Pascals, which have been shown in other works to elicit cell responses in vitro.},

	title = {Subject-specific finite element models of long bones: {An} in vitro evaluation of the overall accuracy},
	volume = {39},
	abstract = {The determination of the mechanical stresses induced in human bones is of great importance in both research and clinical practice. Since the stresses in bones cannot be measured non-invasively in vivo, the only way to estimate them is through subject-specific finite element modelling. Several methods exist for the automatic generation of these models from CT data, but before bringing them in the clinical practice it is necessary to assess their accuracy in the predictions of the bone stresses. Particular attention should be paid to those regions, like the epiphyseal and metaphyseal parts of long bones, where the automatic methods are typically less accurate. Aim of the present study was to implement a general procedure to automatically generate subject-specific finite element models of bones from CT data and estimate the accuracy of this general procedure by applying it to one real femur. This femur was tested in vitro under five different loading scenarios and the results of these tests were used to verify how the adoption of a simplified two-material homogeneous model would change the accuracy with respect to the density-based inhomogeneous one, with special attention paid to the epiphyseal and metaphyseal proximal regions of the bone. The results showed that the density-based inhomogeneous model predicts with a very good accuracy the measured stresses (R(2)=0.91, RMSE=8.6\%, peak error=27\%), while the two-material model was less accurate (R(2)=0.89, RMSE=9.6\%, peak error=35\%). The results showed that it is possible to automatically generate accurate finite element models of bones from CT data and that the strategy of material properties mapping has a significant influence on its accuracy.},

These strategies were applied to the finite element model of a real human femur. The accuracy of the superficial stress and strain predictions was evaluated against experimentally measured values in 13 strain-gauge locations for five different loading conditions. The results obtained for the two material distributions were statistically different. Both models predicted very accurately the superficial stresses, with regression coefficients higher than 0.9 and slopes not significantly different from unity. The second strategy definitely improved the strains prediction accuracy: the regression coefficient raised from 0.69 to 0.79; the average and peak errors decreased from 45.1\% to 31.3\% and from 228\% to 134\% of the maximum measured strain, respectively.

	volume = {18},
	abstract = {Objective. To investigate the biomechanical performance of a newly designed cervico-trochanteric stemless prosthesis by comparing the stress distribution with that of the traditional stem-type porous-coated anatomic prosthesis. Design. Three-dimensional finite element models were created for the intact femur, cervico-trochanteric implanted femur and porous-coated anatomic implanted femur. The stress distributions on the femur and the implant were compared. The effects of using two or three screws fixation for the cervico-trochanteric implanted femur were also investigated. Background. Local bone loss after implantation of traditional stem-type prostheses remains an unsolved problem during the long-term application of total hip replacement. The stress shielding effect and osteolysis were thought to be the two main factors that result in local bone loss after prosthesis implantation. In order to eliminate the mechanical and the biological causes of bone loss after total hip arthroplasty, a newly designed stemless femoral prosthesis was investigated. Methods. Three-dimensional finite element models were created for the intact, cervico-trochanteric (with two or three fixation screws), and porous-coated anatomic implanted femora with the geometry of a standardized composite femur. Analysis was performed for a loading condition simulating the single-legged stance. The von Mises stress distributions of each model were analyzed and compared. Results. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) Von Mises stress in the proximal, medial femur for the cervico-trochanteric implanted model was higher than that of the intact model and the porous-coated anatomic implanted model; (2) stress-shielding effect of the cervico-trochanteric models (with two or three fixation screws) were eliminated as compared with the porous-coated anatomic model; (3) no obvious difference in von Mises stress distribution for the cervico-trochanteric implanted model with two or three fixation screws. Conclusions. The cervico-trochanteric femoral prosthesis may reduce the stress-shielding effect of the proximal femur and achieve a more physiological stress distribution on the proximal femur than that of the porous-coated anatomic prosthesis. Relevance The new concept of cervico-trochanteric stemless prosthesis has proven to possess several advantages based on the current results, and may be an alternative for traditional stem-type prostheses in future clinical applications.},

The results of this investigation strongly support the hypothesis that the femur is loaded primarily in compression, and not bending as previously thought. The finite element analysis demonstrated that a compressive stress distribution in the diaphyseal femur can be achieved, producing a stress distribution which appears to be consistent with the femoral cross-sectional geometry. The finite element analysis also predicted that for a compressive load case there would be negligible deflections of the femoral head.

A finite element model of the turkey ulna, following that of Brown et al., was analysed using the ABAQUS package. The model was validated against the static predictions of the Brown et al. study. A bone remodelling technique, based on swelling algorithms given by Taylor and Clift, was then applied to predict the dramatic change in loading conditions imposed. The resulting changes in FE mid-shaft bone geometry were compared with the remodelling observed experimentally and showed good agreement. The tensile principal stress was found to be the best remodelling signal under the imposed conditions. Localized sensitivities in the remodelling patterns were found, however, and the definition of the dead zone was modified as a result. Remodelling with the new dead-zone definition showed that both the tensile principal stress and the tensile principal strain produced the remodelling patterns that agreed most closely with experiment.},

	abstract = {Femoral neck fractures are an important clinical, social and economic problem. Even if many different attempts have been carried out to improve the accuracy predicting the fracture risk, it was demonstrated in retrospective studies that the standard clinical protocol achieves an accuracy of about 65\%. A new procedure was developed including for the prediction not only bone mineral density but also geometric and femoral strength information and achieving an accuracy of about 80\% in a previous retrospective study. Aim of the present work was to re-engineer research-based procedures and develop a real-time software for the prediction of the risk for femoral fracture. The result was efficient, repeatable and easy to use software for the evaluation of the femoral neck fracture risk to be inserted in the daily clinical practice providing a useful tool for the improvement of fracture prediction.},

	abstract = {This study sought to determine the similarities between features of calculated stress-shielding and observed bone loss in the distal femur after total knee replacement. Stress-shielding was determined by comparing the magnitudes and distributions of strain energy density, calculated using three-dimensional finite element models of the intact bone, the bone after total knee replacement with bonding assumed at all prosthesis-bone interfaces, and the bone after total knee replacement with bonding assumed only at the distal interface. The loading condition simulated static lifting with the knee flexed at 45 degrees, producing tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joint reactions of 900 and 450 N, respectively. The maximum magnitudes of strain energy density calculated using the total knee replacement models were less than 15\% of the corresponding magnitudes from the intact bone model. The greatest difference was found to occur at the anterior distal corner of the femur, suggesting this location as the one most vulnerable to stress-shielding. Clinically observed bone loss after total knee replacement frequently occurs at this location. At the anterior distal corner, the calculated magnitudes for the two total knee replacement models were similar, suggesting that stress-shielding at this location was not reduced by limiting fixation only to the distal interface. Although the study corresponded to one loading condition and one geometry of the total knee replacement femoral component with the inherent limitations of model calculations, the results suggest a possible scenario for stress-shielding.},

	abstract = {Biomechanical properties were assessed from the tibias of 17 adult males 17-46 years of age. Tissue-level mechanical properties varied with bone size. Narrower tibias were comprised of tissue that was more brittle and more prone to accumulating damage compared with tissue from wider tibias. INTRODUCTION: A better understanding of the factors contributing to stress fractures is needed to identify new prevention strategies that will reduce fracture incidence. Having a narrow (i.e., more slender) tibia relative to body mass has been shown to be a major predictor of stress fracture risk and fragility in male military recruits and male athletes. The intriguing possibility that slender bones, like those shown in animal models, may be composed of more damageable material has not been considered in the human skeleton. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Polar moment of inertia, section modulus, and antero-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) widths were determined for tibial diaphyses from 17 male donors 17-46 years of age. A slenderness index was defined as the inverse ratio of the section modulus to tibia length and body weight. Eight prismatic cortical bone samples were generated from each tibia, and tissue-level mechanical properties including modulus, strength, total energy, postyield strain, and tissue damageability were measured by four-point bending from monotonic (n = 4/tibia) and damage accumulation (n = 4/tibia) test methods. Partial correlation coefficients were determined between each geometrical parameter and each tissue-level mechanical property while taking age into consideration. RESULTS: Significant correlations were observed between tibial morphology and the mechanical properties that characterized tissue brittleness and damageability. Positive correlations were observed between measures of bone size (AP width) and measures of tissue ductility (postyield strain, total energy), and negative correlations were observed between bone size (moment of inertia, section modulus) and tissue modulus. CONCLUSIONS: The correlation analysis suggested that bone morphology could be used as a predictor of tissue fragility and stress fracture risk. The average mechanical properties of cortical tissue varied as a function of the overall size of the bone. Therefore, under extreme loading conditions (e.g., military training), variation in bone quality parameters related to damageability may be a contributing factor to the increased risk of stress fracture for individuals with more slender bones.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional simulation of trabecular surface remodeling was conducted for a human proximal femur to investigate the structural change of cancellous bone toward a uniform stress state. Considering that a local mechanical stimulus plays an important role in cellular activities in bone remodeling, local stress nonuniformity was assumed to drive trabecular structural change to seek a uniform stress state. A large-scale pixel-based finite element model was used to simulate structural changes of individual trabeculae over the entire bone. As a result, the initial structure of trabeculae changed from isotropic to anisotropic due to trabecular microstructural changes caused by surface remodeling according to the mechanical environment in the proximal femur. Under a single-loading condition, it was shown that the apparent structural property evaluated by fabric ellipses corresponded to the apparent stress state in cancellous bone. As is observed in the actual bone, a distributed trabecular structure was obtained under a multiple-loading condition. Through these studies, it was concluded that trabecular surface remodeling toward a local uniform stress state at the trabecular level could naturally bring about functional adaptation phenomenon at the apparent tissue level. The proposed simulation model would be capable of providing insight into the hierarchical mechanism of trabecular surface remodeling at the microstructural level up to the apparent tissue level.},

The goals of the current study were (1) to measure and compare the Young's moduli of trabecular and cortical bone tissues from a common human donor, and (2) to compare the Young's moduli of bone tissue measured using acoustic microscopy to those measured using nanoindentation. The Young's modulus of cortical bone in the longitudinal direction was about 40\% greater than (p{\textless}0.01) the Young's modulus in the transverse direction. The Young's modulus of trabecular bone tissue was slightly higher than the transverse Young's modulus of cortical bone, but substantially lower than the longitudinal Young's modulus of cortical bone. These findings were consistent for both measurement methods and suggest that elasticity of trabecular tissue is within the range of that of cortical bone tissue. The calculation of Young's modulus using nanoindentation assumes that the material is elastically isotropic. The current results, i.e., the average anisotropy ratio (E(L)/E(T)) for cortical bone determined by nanoindentation was similar to that determined by the acoustic microscope, suggest that this assumption does not limit nanoindentation as a technique for measurement of Young's modulus in anisotropic bone.},

Total micromovement of less than 10 mum was predicted for the press-fit acetabular components models, much below the 50 mum limit required to encourage osseointegration. Relatively high compressive acetabular and contact stresses were observed in these models. The press-fit procedure showed a moderate influence on the contact mechanics at the bearing surfaces, but produced marked deformation of the acetabular components. No edge contact was predicted for the acetabular components studied. It is concluded that the frictional compressive stresses generated by the 1 mm to 2 mm interference-fit acetabular components, together with the minimal micromovement, would provide adequate stability for the implant, at least in the immediate post-operative situation.},

	abstract = {In this study, we investigate if finite element (FE) analyses of human trabecular bone architecture based on 168 microm images can provide relevant information about the bone mechanical characteristics. Three human trabecular bone samples, one taken from the femoral head, one from the iliac crest, and one from the lumbar spine, were imaged with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) using a 28 microm resolution. After reconstruction the resolution was coarsened to 168 microm. First, all reconstructions were thresholded and directly converted to FE-models built of hexahedral elements. For the coarser resolutions of two samples, this resulted in a loss of trabecular connections and a subsequent loss of stiffness. To reduce this effect, a tetrahedral element meshing based on the marching cubes algorithm, as well as a modified hexahedron meshing, which thresholds the image such that load carrying bone mass is preserved, were employed. For each sample elastic moduli and tissue Von Mises stresses of the three different 168 microm models were compared to those from the hexahedron 28 microm model. For one sample the hexahedron meshing at 168 microm produced excellent results. For the other two samples the results obtained from the hexahedral models at 168 microm resolution were poor. Considerably better results were attained for these samples when using the mass-compensated or tetrahedron meshing techniques. We conclude that the accuracy of the FE-models at 168 microm strongly depends on the bone morphology, in particular its trabecular thickness. A substantial loss of trabecular connections during the hexahedron meshing process indicates that poor FE results will be obtained. In this case the tetrahedron or mass-compensated hexahedron meshing techniques can reduce the loss of connections and produce better results than the plain hexahedron meshing techniques.},

	abstract = {Studies of human joint lubrication mechanisms have led to the conclusion that under normal healthy conditions they are fluid film lubricated. The main features responsible for allowing this mechanism to operate are the dynamic nature of the loading and the compliance of the bearing surfaces (articular cartilage). In contrast, artificial joints, being made of much more rigid materials, have been demonstrated to be lubricated by a mixed regime, where some load is carried by the fluid film and some by solid to solid contact. Since some surface contact takes place then wear remains a problem and friction is much higher than in human joints. The use of compliant surface bearings for artificial joints has been explored and shown to be of great advantage, reproducing the effects of natural joints. However, elastomeric materials are known to degrade in aqueous solutions so this aspect has been examined to ensure a reasonable life in the human body. Joints of the lower limb–hip, knee, and ankle–have similar load and motion patterns and behave in a similar way in terms of lubrication. Joints of the hand are not in any way similar in their behaviour and so a typical upper limb joint, the finger, has been studied to see if improvements can be made to the design of replacement artificial joints. Novel suggestions like plastic on plastic joints have been shown to be an alternative which is worthy of further consideration.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine how closely the present designs of ankle prostheses mimic the unique requirements of the foot and ankle. The three-dimensional range of motion (ROM) of the ankle joint complex, before and after ankle arthrodesis and after implantation of three currently used total ankle prostheses, was investigated. METHODS: The three-dimensional ROM was determined in six fresh-frozen cadaver leg specimens using a 6-df device with an axial load of 200 N and a four-camera high-speed video system. A moment of 100 Nm was applied to the footplate to determine the ROM in the sagittal (dorsiflexion and plantarflexion) and frontal (inversion and eversion) planes. The same moment was applied to the tibia to determine the ROM for the internal and external tibial rotation. The measurements were performed for the normal ankle, the fused ankle, and the AGILITY, HINTEGRA, and S.T.A.R. prostheses. RESULTS: Compared to the normal condition, the ROM for dorsiflexion and plantarflexion was changed for all surgical interventions. The changes were highest for the ankle arthrodesis. The changes due to the prostheses were significantly less than the changes due to ankle arthrodesis. Compared to the normal condition, the total ROM for inversion/eversion was slightly decreased by the fused ankle and not changed by the three-component prostheses (HINTEGRA, S.T.A.R.). However, the ROM for inversion/eversion was significantly higher for the two-component prosthesis, AGILITY. The ROM for internal and external tibial rotation was not altered by the AGILITY and HINTEGRA ankle, but it was significantly reduced by the ankle arthrodesis. S.T.A.R. showed a significant shift of the total ROM toward internal tibial rotation. CONCLUSIONS: The three tested ankle joint prostheses changed the ROM of the ankle joint complex less than ankle fusion did. Total ankle prostheses were shown to replicate normal joint ROM closely. However, ankle arthrodesis was found to reduce the ROM substantially in all three planes: the sagittal, frontal, and horizontal planes. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: With respect to the ROM, total ankle replacement changes the natural ankle joint condition less than ankle arthrodesis, which reduces the ROM in all three planes and might increase stress in adjacent structures. The prosthesis that replicated the normal ankle joint ROM best was the one with the most anatomical design.},

RESULTS: While in dorsiflexion/plantarflexion of the foot, ankle joint fusion increased the movement transfer to tibial rotation by a 2.4 factor and to eversion/inversion by a 18.5 factor, whereas, this movement transfer did not change for all prostheses conditions. The movement transfer between foot eversion and tibial rotation was found to decrease for all ankle prostheses, but more in the AGILITY and S.T.A.R. prosthesis than in the HINTEGRA. CONCLUSIONS: The three tested ankle joint prostheses changed the movement transferred within the ankle joint complex less than ankle fusion did, especially for dorsiflexion/plantarflexion movement of the foot. The closer the design was to the normal anatomy of the ankle, the closer the transfer of movement was shown to be replicated with respect to normal joint. It is suggested that success of total ankle arthroplasty depends on how successfully designs can mimic the movement transfer of the normal ankle, while dissipating the rotational forces and maintaining the stability of the joint.},

	abstract = {The mechanical properties of cancellous bone depend on its architecture and the tissue properties of the mineralized matrix. The architecture is continuously adapted to external loads. In this paper, it was assumed that changes in tissue properties leading to changes in tissue deformation can induce adaptation of the architecture. We asked whether changes in cancellous bone architecture with aging and in e.g. early osteoarthrosis can be explained from changes in tissue properties.This was investigated using computer models in which the cancellous architecture was adapted to external loads. Bone tissue with deformations below a certain threshold was resorbed, deformations above another threshold induced formation. Deformations between these two boundaries, in the 'lazy zone', did not induce bone adaptation. The effects of changes in bone tissue stiffness on bone mass, global stiffness and architecture were investigated. The bone gain (40-60\%) resulting from a 50\% decrease in tissue stiffness (simulating diseased tissue) was much larger than the bone loss (2-30\%) resulting from a 50\% increase in tissue stiffness (simulating highly mineralized, old tissue). The adaptation induced by a decrease in tissue stiffness resulted in an almost constant stiffness in the main load bearing direction, but the transversal stiffness decreased. An increased tissue stiffness resulted in a higher stiffness in the main direction and overcompensation in the transversal directions: the global stiffness could become even smaller than the stiffness of the original model. Concluding, we showed that changes in trabecular bone in aging and diseases can be partly explained from changes in tissue properties.},

A radiostereophotogrammetric analysis was performed to determine the influence of stem extension on mechanical stability in a laboratory experiment. In addition, the contribution of impacted morselized bone graft used for reconstruction of bone defects to stability was determined. Ten fresh frozen distal femoral specimens, of which the bone mineral density was measured, were prepared to fit a cemented femoral component with an uncemented stem. A cyclic axial load of 750 N was applied to the medial part of the femoral component. The loading test was repeated after creation of a standard, unicondylar, uncontained medial bone defect, after reconstruction of the defect with impacted morselized bone graft, after disconnecting the stem from the component, and after removal of the morselized bone graft. A significant difference was found in rotation and translation of the femoral component with the stem and after its functional removal. The femoral component rotated significantly into varus and internal rotation, and the tip of the stem translated significantly laterally after disconnection of the stem. A linear correlation between bone mineral density in the femoral neck and the radiostereophotogrammetric motion data was absent, but a bone mineral density threshold level of 0.55 g/cm2 was present, below which stability decreased considerably. Morselized bone graft provided only a minor contribution to stability compared with a stem.},

	volume = {18},
	issn = {0884-0431},
	abstract = {Quantitative information about bone tissue-level loading is essential for understanding bone mechanical behavior. We made microfinite element models of a healthy and osteoporotic human femur and found that tissue-level strains in the osteoporotic femoral head were 70\% higher on average and less uniformly distributed than those in the healthy one. INTRODUCTION: Bone tissue stresses and strains in healthy load-adapted trabecular architectures should be distributed rather evenly, because no bone tissue is expected to be overloaded or unused. In this study, we evaluate this paradigm with the use of microfinite element (microFE) analyses to calculate tissue-level stresses and strains for the human femur. Our objectives were to quantify the strain distribution in the healthy femur, to investigate to what extent this distribution is affected by osteoporosis, to determine if osteoporotic bone is simply bone adapted to lower load levels, and to determine the "safety factor" for trabecular bone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: microFE models of a healthy and osteoporotic proximal femur were made from microcomputed tomography images. The models consisted of over 96 and 71 million elements for the healthy and osteoporotic femur, respectively, and represented their internal and external morphology in detail. Stresses and strains were calculated for each element and their distributions were calculated for a volume of interest (VOI) of trabecular bone in the femoral head. RESULTS: The average tissue-level principal strain magnitude in the healthy VOI was 304 +/- 185 microstrains and that in the osteoporotic VOI was 520 +/- 355 microstrains. Calculated safety factors were 8.6 for the healthy and 4.9 for the osteoporotic femurs. After reducing the force applied to the osteoporotic model to 59\%, the average strain compared with that of the healthy femur, but the SD was larger (208 microstrains). CONCLUSIONS: Strain magnitudes in the osteoporotic bone were much higher and less uniformly distributed than those in the healthy one. After simulated joint-load reduction, strain magnitudes in the osteoporotic femur were very similar to those in the healthy one, but their distribution is still wider and thus less favorable.},

Also recently, new peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques have been developed that can create images of whole bones in vivo with enough detail to visualize the internal cancellous bone architecture. In this study we aim to investigate if the calculation of cancellous bone mechanical properties from micro-FE models based on such new pQCT and MR images is feasible. Three bone specimens were imaged with the pQCT scanning system and the MR-imaging system. The specimens were scanned a second time using a micro-CT scanner with a much higher resolution. Digitized reconstructions were made based on each set of images and converted to micro-FE models from which the bone elastic properties were calculated. It was found that the results of both the pQCT and the MR-based FE-models compared well to those of the more accurate micro-CT based models in a qualitative sense, but correction factors will be needed to get accurate values.},

	abstract = {A canine hip replacement model was used to compare fixation stability in cemented and cementless femoral components. Parameters of comparison were the load-induced positional changes of each prosthesis relative to its proximal femoral cortex, hereafter called relative displacements. Identical femoral components, with the proximal third of their stem porous-coated, were implanted in the right femurs of 10 large, mixed-breed dogs. Five were tightly fit to allow porous ingrowth, and five were cemented into the medullary canal. Four months after implantation, all femurs were harvested. A prosthesis was implanted in the left (normal) femur of each dog ex vivo with fixation identical to the contralateral limb to simulate acute postoperative fixation. Eddy current transducers measured relative displacements under application of static loads, serially applied in the axial, mediolateral, and craniocaudal directions. Thereafter, the femurs were transversely sectioned and morphologically analyzed to correlate bony apposition at the implant surface with relative displacements. We observed no difference in relative displacements between acute and 4-month-cemented groups (e.g., 0.0059 +/- 0.0021 vs. 0.0060 +/- 0.0048 mm, respectively, for 100-N axial loading measured at midstem). With cementless implantation, relative displacements of the acute group were significantly larger (p = 0.007) than those of the 4-month group (e.g., 0.236 +/- 0.257 vs. 0.097 +/- 0.129 mm, respectively, for 100-N axial loading measured at midstem). Cementless components implanted for 4 months were not significantly different than cemented components, but a trend suggested that they were still not as stable as cemented components, particularly for craniocaudal loads. Relative displacements of the 4-month, porous ingrowth group were approximately proportional to the percentage of bony apposition raised to the -1.44 power (r = 0.94).},

The purpose of this study was to experimentally validate the previously proposed microcrack-based toughening mechanism in cortical bone. Crack initiation and propagation tests were conducted on cortical bone compact tension specimens obtained from the antlers of red deer. For these tests, the main fracture crack was either propagated to a predetermined crack length or was stopped immediately after initiating from the notch. The microcracks produced in both groups of specimens were counted in the same surface area of interest around and below the notch, and crack growth resistance and crack propagation velocity were analyzed. There were more microcracks in the surface area of interest in the propagation than in initiation specimens showing that the formation of microcracks continued after the initiation of a fracture crack. Crack growth resistance increased with crack extension, and crack propagation velocity vs. crack extension curves demonstrated the characteristic jump increase and decrease pattern associated with the formation of microcracks. The scanning electron micrographs of crack initiation and propagation displayed the formation of a frontal process zone and a wake, respectively. These results support the microcrack-based toughening mechanism in cortical bone. Bone toughness is, therefore, determined by its ability to form microcracks during fracture.},

The inventors of the device under investigation claimed that, when compared to a comparable fully cemented stem, the new stem would present various advantages. Two previous experimental studies confirmed that primary stability and stress shielding were comparable to those of cemented stems. Aim of the present study was to investigate if the remaining claims were confirmed as well. A complete finite element model of the bone-implant complex was created from CT data. The model was validated against in vitro measurements of bone surface strains as well as against primary stability measurements. The peak stresses predicted in the CLU cement mantle were not found significantly lower than those reported in other studies on fully cemented stems. However, once the cement inlet geometry is optimised and the associated stress risers are eliminated, the CLU cement mantle should be subjected to much lower stresses. The stress induced in the stems by both load cases was well below the fatigue limit of the Ti6Al4V alloy. Finite element models predicted for all load cases relative motion between cement and metal lower than 60 microm. This amplitude may be fully accommodated by elastic deformations of the cement micro-ridges. The experimental and numerical results showed the validity of the new fixation concept, although a further optimisation of the geometry of the cement pockets is needed in order to further reduce the stresses in the cement.},

In the present work, two of these methods, namely the Standard Marching Cube (SMC) and the Discretized Marching Cube (DMC) algorithms, were compared in terms of local accuracy when used to reconstruct the geometry of a human femur. The SMC method was found to be more accurate than the DMC method. The SMC method was capable of reconstructing the inner and outer geometry of a human femur with a peak error lower than 0.9 mm and an average error comparable to the pixel size (0.3 mm). However, the large number of triangles generated by the algorithm may limit its adoption in many modelling applications. The peak error of the DMC algorithm was 1.6 mm but it produced approximately 70\% less triangles than the SMC method. From the results of this study, it may be concluded that three dimensional segmentation algorithms are useful not only in visualisation applications but also in the creation of geometry models.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine age and gender effects on outcomes after inpatient rehabilitation in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and revision TKA patients. DESIGN: This retrospective, comparative study was conducted in a 50-bed, university-affiliated rehabilitation hospital. Patients included primary TKA patients (n = 286) and revision TKA patients (n = 138) placed into one of three age brackets: {\textless}60 yrs, 60-70 yrs, or {\textgreater}70 yrs. Measurements included length of stay (LOS), FIM scores, hospital charges, and discharge disposition location. RESULTS: FIM scores improved from admission to discharge in both primary and revision patients (P = 0.015). LOS was shorter in primary than revision patients (8.3 vs. 10.4 days, P = 0.001), and the LOS was longest in patients {\textgreater}70 yrs compared with those {\textless}60 or 60-70 yrs (10.6 vs. 8.7 and 8.8 days, respectively; P = 0.004). FIM efficiency was greater in primary than in revision TKA patients (3.68 vs. 2.77 points/day, P = 0.001), and greater for men than women in each age bracket regardless of TKA type (3.68 vs. 2.78 points/day, P = 0.001). Total hospital charges were lower for men than women for both TKA types (\$9,656 +/- 823 vs. \$11,544 +/- 1,359; P = 0.015), and were highest in patients {\textgreater}70 yrs of age (P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Primary and revision TKA patients make improvements in functional independence during inpatient rehabilitation. Although FIM gains were similar among age and gender groupings, FIM efficiency is lowest in women. Despite similar daily hospital costs among the groups, slower progress with functional gains (decreased FIM efficiency) increases the LOS and total hospital charges, especially in older women.},

	abstract = {In this study we present the analysis of in vivo micro-CT scans using a new method based on image registration that accurately evaluates longitudinal micro-CT studies. We tested if detailed changes in the bone architecture could be detected and tracked in individual animals. A prototype in vivo micro-CT scanner (Skyscan 1076) was developed in which tibiae of rats that are lying on a bed under gas anaesthesia were scanned. For this study, three female Wistar rats were used: a sham-operated rat, an ovariectomised (OVX) rat and one rat that served as a reproducibility control. The reproducibility control rat was scanned twice in 1 day. The other animals were scanned at week 0, just before surgery, at week 4 and at week 14 after surgery. Architectural changes over time were detected by overlaying two data sets made at different time points using an algorithm that uses mutual information for optimal registration. The scans were segmented into binary data sets using a local thresholding algorithm. The reproducibility test showed small errors of less than 3\% in bone volume measurements and errors less than 0.5\% in measurements of trabecular thickness. The sham-operated rat showed no changes in total bone volume, though thinning and eventual loss of some small trabeculae could be detected, which could be related to the age of the animal. The OVX rat lost much trabecular bone volume, especially in the metaphysis (60\% at week 4, 75\% at week 14). The remaining trabeculae slowly increased in thickness. Following the different scans in time showed the forming of new trabecular structures. Additionally, small longitudinal growth at the growth plate could be detected after the first 4 weeks. Further, the OVX rat showed extensive modelling at the proximal endosteal lateral cortex. We have shown a new method that can detect and track changes in the local bone architecture and individual trabeculae in time, in an individual living animal. This method enables longitudinal in vivo micro-CT studies and has the potential to greatly contribute to experimental rat or mouse studies on pharmacological intervention and transgenic models.},

	abstract = {Trabecular damage may play a role in hip fracture, bone remodeling, and prosthesis loosening. We hypothesized that when trabecular bone is loaded beyond its elastic range, both the type and the amount of damage depend on the applied strains. Thirty specimens of trabecular bone from the bovine tibia underwent compression tests to one of three levels of strain (0.4. 1.0. and 2.5\%) (n = 10 per group). The 0.4\% level was a mechanically nondestructive control group that accounted for any systematic errors. Optical microscopy at magnifications as high as x200 was then used to quantify the trabecular damage for each group. The amount of damage in the yield group (1.0\% strain) did not differ from that in the control group (p = 0.66), whereas damage in the post-ultimate strain group (2.5\% strain) increased more than 3-fold (p {\textless} 0.0008). Four types of damage were observed: transverse cracks, shear bands, parallel cracks, and complete fractures, of which the first two were dominant. These findings therefore indicate that damage occurs within trabeculae at yield. By comparison with our previous work, it can also be concluded that substantial modulus reductions in trabecular bone (as much as 60\%) are caused by damage primarily within trabeculae. The ability to detect such damage clinically may improve in vivo estimates of whole-bone strength by identifying regions of densitometrically normal but mechanically compromised trabecular bone.},

This work describes the development of in vitro specimens suitable for biomechanical modeling of cemented femoral hip replacements with a fibrous tissue layer at the bone-cement interface. In particular, a series of uniaxial compression tests were performed on silicone elastomer specimens to identify a suitable analogue with similar mechanical characteristics to those reported for the fibrous tissue layer. A method was developed to apply the silicone elastomer at the bone-cement interface. This was examined for two types of cemented hip replacements implanted in composite femurs. The selected thickness of the elastomer layers was in the range of those found in clinical cases of aseptic loosening. Specimens produced by these methods could be used in preclinical biomechanical tests (such as stability or stress shielding tests) to assess the effects of a soft-tissue layer, to model in vitro a long-term-implant scenario, and to provide validation for similar finite element studies.},

	title = {Innovation in total hip replacement–when is new better?},
	abstract = {Although many designs of total hip replacement have high success rates at followup times of 10 years and more, new designs continue to be introduced. Some of these designs are similar to what is available already, but may offer advantages such as additional sizes or improved materials. In such cases, a key question is whether the new implant will produce the best possible results for routine use. Rather than simply relying on long-term followup data, which would eliminate the widespread use of a new device for a long time, it is suggested that the vast experience and knowledge of the orthopaedic community should be used. The proposal is that an authoritative group of individuals formulate a specification of the design features of total hip replacement which produce successful results. A second key question is how to be reasonably certain that a device with significantly new features, materials or techniques, is better and whether and when it should be used, either routinely or for specific indications. The proposal is that federal funding should be available to the research community for the specification and development of extensively researched and validated test methods. A point which is applicable to all innovations is that rather than relying on only one test or on a limited number of tests to validate the device, the Design Method must be used. This method involves the formulation of a methodical series of tests, preclinical and clinical, covering all combinations of use of the device. There are no simple answers to validating a design, but there are positive signs that new innovations are being introduced more carefully than in the past, and that many of these innovations will lead to improved long-term results.},

In laboratory studies of penetration in the upper tibia, penetration was approximately proportional to bone pore diameter and to the square root of the applied pressure and inversely proportional to the time after initial mixing. There was a low correlation of the tensile strength of the cement-bone bond with the depth of penetration, probably due to the variability of the trabecular bone strength. Failure occurred by direct cement pullout or by partial or total fracture through the bone. In light of all factors, the suggested ideal depth of cement penetration is 3-4 mm. This penetration can be achieved by using the left-lift method about four minutes after initial cement mixing, but with some selective prepenetration around the periphery of the tibia.},

	abstract = {Using a mathematical model which relates bone density to daily stress histories, the influence of physical activities on the apparent density of the calcaneal cancellous bone was investigated. Assuming that the mechanical bone maintenance stimulus is constant for all bone tissue, bone apparent density was calculated by a linear superposition of the mechanical stimulus provided by different daily physical activities. An empirical weighting factor, m, accounted for possible differences in the relative importance of load magnitude and number of cycles in each activity. By considering hypothetical variations in body weight and occupational activity levels, the range of probable m values was established. The model was then applied to the results of two previous running studies in which calcaneal density was measured to obtain an estimate of the stress exponent parameter, m. The results indicate that stress magnitudes (or joint forces) have a greater influence on bone mass than the number of loading cycles. We demonstrate that by carefully considering the magnitudes of imposed skeletal forces and the number of loading cycles, it may be possible to design exercise programs to achieve predictable changes in bone mass.},

In order to explore the contribution of matrix stretching, we sought to answer the following questions in an animal model: (a) Are the tensile properties of the lateral side of the proximal tibial physis different from the medial? (b) Are the tensile properties strain-rate dependent? (c) Does the growth plate fracture through any preferred zone in tension? (d) Are the tensile properties of the bovine growth plate a function of age? (e) Are thicker growth plates weaker in tension? (f) Are the tensile properties of the bovine growth plate comparable to those of a child's? We compared bone-cartilage-bone specimens (0.5 x 2.5 mm2 in cross-section) from the lateral, central and medial regions of the proximal tibial growth plates of 12- to 18-month heifers. 70 specimens were tested to failure in tension at 0.0004, 0.004 and 0.04 mm/s. Tensile strength and tangent modulus were 33\% and 25\% greater, respectively, on the lateral side compared with the medial, and both were increased at the higher strain rates. We found no difference in the ultimate strains by region or strain rate. Thicker growth plates were weaker. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a three-dimensional fracture pattern extending from the upper columnar into the reserve zone. Bundles of intact chondrons remained intact, but only on the metaphyseal side, having been torn from an interterritorial matrix which remained mostly on the epiphyseal side of the fracture. We compared 21 specimens of 12- to 18-month and 19 specimens of 5-month calves from similar regions of the proximal tibia. These were tested to failure in tension at 0.004 mm/s. The older bovine growth plate was 25\% thinner, 34\% stronger and failed at 65\% greater strain. For comparison, we tested eight samples from the femoral capital growth plate of two cerebral palsy patients.

The composites are manufactured using well-aligned bovine cancellous bone from the proximal end of the tibia and low viscosity bone cement. Selected composites are also subjected to mechanical compression tests to compare with the ultrasonic results. There is excellent correlation between the dynamic or ultrasonically determined moduli and the static or mechanically determined moduli; the dynamic moduli are approximately twice the static moduli and this difference is thought to be due to the effect of strain rate. An orthotropic model is assumed requiring nine independent elastic constants to be determined. The dynamic Young's modulus in the direction of major trabecular alignment, E1, increases linearly from 4.9 to 10.4 GPa as bone volume fraction increases from 0 to 0.4; dynamic E2 and E3 values increase from 4.9 to 7 GPa as bone volume fractions increase from 0 to 0.4, with E2 being slightly higher than E3.

The Poisson's ratios are more sensitive than the Young's moduli and shear moduli to experimental error in the velocity measurements. The mechanically tested modulus (static modulus) in the direction of major trabecular alignment, E1, increases with volume fraction of bone from 2.4 to 4.4 GPa as the bone volume fraction increases from 0 to 0.25; static E2 and E3 values are either equal to or lower than that of pure PMMA.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: In contrast to many isotropic finite-element (FE) models of the femur in literature, it was the object of our study to develop an orthotropic FE "model femur" to realistically simulate three-dimensional bone remodelling. METHODS: The three-dimensional geometry of the proximal femur was reconstructed by CT scans of a pair of cadaveric femurs at equal distances of 2mm. These three-dimensional CT models were implemented into an FE simulation tool. Well-known "density-determined" bony material properties (Young's modulus; Poisson's ratio; ultimate strength in pressure, tension and torsion; shear modulus) were assigned to each FE of the same "CT-density-characterized" volumetric group.In order to fix the principal directions of stiffness in FE areas with the same "density characterization", the cadaveric femurs were cut in 2mm slices in frontal (left femur) and sagittal plane (right femur). Each femoral slice was scanned into a computer-based image processing system. On these images, the principal directions of stiffness of cancellous and cortical bone were determined manually using the orientation of the trabecular structures and the Haversian system. Finally, these geometric data were matched with the "CT-density characterized" three-dimensional femur model. In addition, the time and density-dependent adaptive behaviour of bone remodelling was taken into account by implementation of Carter's criterion. RESULTS: In the constructed "model femur", each FE is characterized by the principal directions of the stiffness and the "CT-density-determined" material properties of cortical and cancellous bone. Thus, on the basis of anatomic data a three-dimensional FE simulation reference model of the proximal femur was realized considering orthotropic conditions of bone behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: With the orthotropic "model femur", the fundamental basis has been formed to realize realistic simulations of the dynamical processes of bone remodelling under different loading conditions or operative procedures (osteotomies, total hip replacements, etc).},

	abstract = {The role of mechanical stresses in the formation of endochondral ossification patterns and the construction of basic bone architecture in human long bones is investigated using a three-dimensional generalized model of long bone development. The distribution of mechanical stress which is created in developing bones as a result of intermittent mechanical loading is calculated using a computer model that mathematically represents the bone's geometry, material properties and loading conditions. The process of endochondral ossification is simulated by iteratively converting cartilaginous regions of the computer model to bone, based on the calculated intermittent hydrostatic and shear stress distributions. Once local regions of mineralized bone have formed, these regions are remodeled according to an algorithm which relates bone density to a mechanical stress stimulus. The results simulated the correct sequence of the appearance of morphological structures which are common to long bones in the human appendicular skeleton. These developmental structures include the site of the first endochondral bone and the secondary ossification center and the tubular nature of long bones. Our results suggest that mechanical loading histories may influence bone morphogenesis beginning from the early stages of endochondral ossification and continuing throughout life. The stress-based algorithms may be part of the 'rules of construction' or 'developmental constraints' which guide limb ontogeny.},

Simplified three-dimensional axisymmetric models of the femur and seven implants with different core diameters, external diameters, implant lengths and thread pitches were derived. The resulting stress and strain distributions were compared. The significance of each implant geometry was identified for improving implant design in the light of benefit to the bone/implant osseointegration and the bone remodelling of the femur.},

	abstract = {A new fully automatic hex-dominant mesh generation technique of an arbitrary 3D geometric domain is presented herein. The proposed method generates a high-quality hex-dominant mesh by: (1) controlling the directionality of the output hex-dominant mesh; and (2) avoiding ill-shaped elements induced by nodes located too closely to each other. The proposed method takes a 3D geometric domain as input and creates a hex-dominant mesh consisting mostly of hexahedral elements, with additional prism and tetrahedral elements. Rectangular solid cells are packed on the boundary of and inside the input domain to obtain ideal node locations for a hex-dominant mesh. Each cell has a potential energy field that mimics a body-centred cubic (BCC) structure (seen in natural substances such as NaCl) and the cells are moved to stable positions by a physically based simulation. The simulation mimics the formation of a crystal pattern so that the centres of the cells provide ideal node locations for a hex-dominant mesh. Via the advancing front method, the centres of the packed cells are then connected to form a tetrahedral mesh, and this is converted to a hex-dominant mesh by merging some of the tetrahedrons.

Using a rate-dependent model of a fiber-bridged microcrack and data from the literature, we demonstrate that the experimental apparent yield strength of bone can be predicted directly from measurements of apparent moduli of elasticity of bone constituents and failure strain of the collagenous matrix.Yield strength predictions for estrogen depleted bone were made using the model and data from ovariectomized sheep. It was predicted that the yield strength of estrogen-deficient bone is comparable to that of normal bone within strain rates associated with physiological activities. For high strain rates, however, the strength of estrogen-depleted bone was predicted to be much weaker than normals suggesting a higher fracture risk due to impact from falls, for individuals with estrogen-depleted bones such as in post-menopausal osteoporosis.},

Three representative cups, characterized by the cup wall thickness as thin, intermediate, and thick, were considered. For the intermediate cup, the effects of both the size and the diametral interference on the cup deformation were investigated. Both two-dimensional axisymmetric and three-dimensional finite element models were developed to examine the important parameters during and after the press-fit procedure, and in particular the deformation of the metallic cup. The theoretical prediction of the cup deformation was in reasonable agreement with the corresponding experimental measurement reported in Part 1. The most significant factor influencing the cup deformation was the cup wall thickness. Both the size and the diametral interference were also shown to influence the cup deformation. It is important to ensure that the cup deformation does not significantly affect the clearance designed and optimized for tribological performances of metal-on-metal hip resurfacing prostheses. Furthermore the contact parameters at the cup and bone interface associated with the press fit were also discussed.},

For axial loading tests, cyclical compressive loads ranging 50-1000 N were applied to the anterolateral portion of the implanted tray. With subsidence on the loaded side and lift-off on the contralateral side, micromotions on both sides and bending of the tray were measured. The three groups consisted of a stemless group, a 7.5 cm (short) central stem group, and a 15 cm (long) central stem group. For shear loading tests, shear loads ranging 20-250 N were applied to the central portion of the posterior rim of the tray anteriorly for 1,000 cycles. Displacement values for subsidence and micromotion were measured on the medial and lateral side of the trays and compared for each group. For axial tests, the long stem minimized subsidence and lift-off (P {\textless} .05) when compared to the stemless group. Although the short stem also tended to prevent contralateral lift-off, no significant difference was shown when compared to the stemless group. However for shear loading, both central stem lengths significantly reduced subsidence and micromotion (P {\textless} .05). The authors conclude that the tibial tray with a long stem can achieve better initiation fixation of the implant to bone when compared to the short stem and no stem groups.},

In this study, a novel computer-controlled stretch device and parallel plate flow chamber were employed to investigate cytosolic calcium (Ca2+i) mobilization in response to a range of dynamic substrate strain levels (0.1-10 percent, 1 Hz) and oscillating fluid flow (2 N/m2, 1 Hz). In addition, we quantified the effect of dynamic substrate strain and oscillating fluid flow on the expression of mRNA for the bone matrix protein osteopontin (OPN). Our data demonstrate that continuum strain levels observed for routine physical activities ({\textless} 0.5 percent) do not induce Ca2+i responses in osteoblastic cells in vitro. However, there was a significant increase in the number of responding cells at larger strain levels. Moreover, we found no change in osteopontin mRNA level in response to 0.5 percent strain at 1 Hz. In contrast, oscillating fluid flow predicted to occur in the lacunar-canalicular system due to routine physical activities (2 N/m2, 1 Hz) caused significant increases in both Ca2+i and OPN mRNA. These data suggest that, relative to fluid flow, substrate deformation may play less of a role in bone cell mechanotransduction associated with bone adaptation to routine loads.},

The results revealed that errors of reconstructed object points were related to the focus position error, two-dimensional measurement error, position of focus and positions of object points, while errors of reconstructed focus position were determined by the two-dimensional measurement error, number of control points and location of the focus. The maximum difference between the mathematical model and the simulation for the assessment of errors of focus position was 14 microm and the maximum difference of object point positions was 1.1 microm. These differences were small and judged irrelevant, hence the simulations indicated that our models were accurate.},

However, automated contact has found limited use in the biomechanical literature. A non-linear, three-dimensional, geometrically accurate, FE analysis of the trans-tibial limb-socket prosthetic system was used to compare an automated contact interface model with a gap element model, and to evaluate the sensitivity of automated contact to interfacial coefficient of friction (COF). Peak normal stresses and resultant shear stresses were higher in the gap element model than in the automated contact model, while the maximum axial slip was less. Under proximally directed load, compared with automated contact, gap elements predicted larger areas of stress concentration that were located more distally. Gap elements did not predict any relative slip at the distal end, and also transmitted a larger proportion of axial load as shear stress. Both models demonstrated non -linear sensitivity to COF, with larger variation at lower magnitudes of COF. By imposing physical connections between interface surfaces, gap elements distort the interface stress distributions under large slip. Automated contact methods offer an attractive alternative in applications such as prosthetic FE modeling, where the initial position of the limb in the socket is not known, where local geometric features have high design significance, and where large slip occurs under load.},

	abstract = {Outcome evaluations of lower extremity joint reconstructions should include an assessment of patient activity. In vivo wear assessments of total joint prostheses should be based on a measure of use, not time in situ or a proxy such as age or gender; however, clinicians lack a simple method to reliably assess the activity of patients with joint replacement. The modern pedometer can be a satisfactory means of quantifying the use of lower extremity joints. The pedometer, however, requires special effort on the part of the physician or evaluator and the patient. Therefore, we compared the quantitative assessment of walking activity of 100 total joint replacement patients, as measured with a pedometer, to the UCLA activity score and a simple visual analog scale that can easily be employed during a routine office evaluation. Both the UCLA activity rating (P = .002) and the visual analog scale rating of the investigator (P = .00001) had a strong correlation with the average steps per day as recorded by the pedometer. There was, however, up to a 15-fold difference in the average steps per day for individual patients with the same UCLA score. The visual analog scale as rated by the patients of their own activity did not have as strong a correlation with the pedometer data (P = .08) as did patient age (P = .049). For practical reasons, the pedometer is probably best reserved for the evaluation of extreme cases of activity (or inactivity). This study indicates that both the UCLA activity rating and the investigator visual analog scale are valid for routine activity assessment in a clinical setting. Adjustments of the UCLA activity score for the frequency and intensity of activity, as can be done with the investigator visual analog scale, increase the accuracy of the activity rating.},

	abstract = {X-ray CT has the potential to provide precise and accurate data from which the mechanical properties of bone can be derived. Such data would be useful in understanding bone behaviour around metallic orthopaedic implants. Metallic objects, however, generate artifacts, typically seen as starburst streaking, which can seriously degrade the accuracy of the data. The aim of this study was to evaluate new generation CT scanners accuracy in the assessment of geometric shape and features of titanium hip joint prosthetic stems. A measuring procedure has been developed and its accuracy assessed. This procedure compares the metal stem contours obtained from the transaxial CT images to the cross section of the stem solid model provided by the producer. Results show that modern CT scanners images provide precise information about geometric shape and features of titanium orthopaedic implants. CT reconstruction accuracy, in fact, has shown to be comparable to the image pixel size (0.3 mm) which is the theoretical limit of the resolution of the CT scanner. Two hip joint titanium implants with the same geometry and a different calliper have been analyzed. Smaller calliper stem yielded slightly higher errors, suggesting that CT accuracy depends on the implant dimensions and geometry. However, for both stems, the 90\% of the measured errors fell within 0.6 mm (2 pixels) which can be regarded as the lower bound for titanium stem reconstruction accuracy},

In this modeling approach, a four-segment seven-DOF linkage is employed to represent the torso and right arm. Kinematic redundancy is resolved efficiently in the velocity domain via a weighted pseudoinverse. Weights assigned to individual DOF describe their relative movement contribution in response to an instantaneous postural change. Different schemes of posing constraints on the weighting parameters, by which various motion apportionment strategies are modeled, can be hypothesized and evaluated against empirical measurements. A numerical optimization procedure based on simulated annealing estimate the weighting parameter values such that the predicted movement best fits the measurement. We applied this approach to modeling 72 seated reaching movements of three distinctive types performed by six subjects. Results indicated that most of the movements were accurately modeled (time-averaged RMSE {\textless} 5 degrees) with a simple time-invariant four-weight scheme which represents a time-constant, inter-joint motion apportionment strategy. Modeling error could be further reduced by using less constrained schemes, but notably only for the ones that were relatively poorly modeled with a time-invariant four-weight scheme. The fact that the current modeling approach was able to closely reproduce measured movements and do so in a computationally advantageous way lends support to the proposed velocity control strategy.},

	abstract = {This article will provide an overview of state-of-the-art combinatorial/high-throughput methodologies and tools for accelerated materials research and discovery. Combinatorial thin films with discrete composition libraries or continuous composition gradients (spreads) have been widely used to study compositionâ€“structureâ€“property relationships and to discover new functional materials. A diffusion-multiple approachâ€”the creation of composition gradients and intermetallic phases by long-term annealing of junctions of three or more phases/alloysâ€”enables effective studies of phase diagrams, kinetics, and compositionâ€“structureâ€“property relationships of bulk alloys. Such studies are made possible by localized property measurements using micro-scale probes/measurement tools. Micro-scale probes for several properties such as elastic modulus, hardness, thermal conductivity, dielectric properties, optical properties, and crystal structures are relatively well developed and will be discussed in detail. The probes for electrical conductivity, magnetic properties, and compressive yield strength need further improvement or more benchmark studies. All these micro-scale probes are very useful for materials research. For instance, a micro-scale thermal conductivity probe can be used to study orderâ€“disorder transformation, site preference in intermetallic compounds, solid-solution effects on conductivity, and compositional point defect propensity. Several probes can be combined to accelerate the development of structural materials to obtain phase diagrams, diffusion coefficients, precipitation kinetics, solution-strengthening effects, and precipitation-strengthening effects. The probes yet to be developed that would have a significant impact on materials research include ones for lattice parameter measurements at micron-scale resolution, localized melting point measurements, ductility, thermal expansion coefficients, and thermodynamic properties. The impact of the development of the micro-scale probes goes beyond combinatorial materials research since most of them can be applied to non-combinatorial metallographic or thin film samples as well. Examples will show that in addition to improved efficiency, the systematic nature of the combinatorial approaches can reveal complex phenomena and interactions that otherwise would be difficult to be aware of or find using conventional one-composition-at-a-time practice, especially when measurements of several properties are made using multiple probes},

The three-dimensional morphology of trabecular bone was assessed with a microcomputed tomography system and the method of directed secants as well as the star volume procedure were used to compute mean intercept length (MIL) and average bone length (ABL) of 4 mm cubic specimens. Assuming isotropic elastic properties for the trabecular tissue, the general elastic tensors of the bone specimens were determined using the homogenization method and the closest orthotropic tensors were calculated with an optimization algorithm. The assumption of orthotropy for trabecular bone was found to improve with specimen size and hold within 6.1 percent for a 4 mm cube size. A strong global relationship (r2 = 0.95) was obtained between fabric and the orthotropic elastic tensor with a minimal set of five constants. Mean intercept length and average bone length provided an equivalent power of prediction.

	abstract = {The mechanical properties of bone tissue are determined by composition as well as structural, microstructural and nanostructural organization. The aim of this study was to quantify the elastic properties of bone at the lamellar level and compare these properties among osteonal, interstitial and trabecular microstructures from the diaphysis and the neck of the human femur. A nanoindentation technique with a custom irrigation system was used for simultaneously measuring force and displacement of a diamond tip pressed 500 nm into the moist bone tissue. An isotropic elastic modulus was calculated from the unloading curve with an assumed Poisson ratio of 0.3, while hardness was defined as the maximal force divided by the corresponding contact area. The elastic moduli ranged from 6.9 +/- 4.3 GPa in trabecular tissue from the femoral neck of a 74 yr old female up to 25.0 +/- 4.3 GPa in interstitial tissue from the diaphyseal cortex of a 69 yr old female. The mean elastic modulus was found to be significantly influenced by the type of lamella (p {\textless} 10(-6)) and by donor (p {\textless} 10(-6)). The interaction between the type of lamella and the donor was also highly significant (p {\textless} 10(-6)). Hardness followed a similar distribution as elastic modulus among types of lamellae and donor, but with lower statistical contrast. It is concluded that the nanostructure of bone tissue must differ substantially among lamellar types, anatomical sites and individuals and suggests that tissue heterogeneity is of potential importance in bone fragility and adaptation.},

	abstract = {When adults reach to grasp stationary targets, movement kinematics (endpoint trajectories, interjoint coordination) are highly stereotyped and stable. The emergence of an optimal coordination for reaching involves mastering the redundant number of degrees of freedom while the body grows. Reaching has been well studied in healthy children under the age of 3 years. We characterised the development of coordination during reaching in children over the age of 3 years and identified age ranges in which stable patterns emerge. A random sample of 38 healthy children aged 4-11 years and nine adults participated in the study. They reached from the seated position with the dominant arm and grasped a cone placed at three distances in the forward sagittal plane in front of the body. Kinematic data from markers placed on the arm, head and trunk were recorded at 100 Hz (Optotrak Motion Analysis System). Immature patterns of reaching were characterised by increased variability in younger compared to older children. Hand trajectories became smoother and less variable with age. Interjoint coordination became more consistent, while trunk displacement and variability decreased with age. Only children between 8 and 10 years old had variability similar to adults. Our data suggest that different aspects of movement kinematics mature at different rates. However, our data do not support the idea of a sequential maturation of different biomechanical variables.},

As part of this monitoring campaign, a detailed characterization of PM2.5 diesel engine emissions from the tailpipe and crankcase emissions from the road draft tubes was performed. To distinguish between tailpipe and crankcase vent emissions, a deuterated alkane, n-hexatriacontane-d74 (n-C36D74) was added to the engine oil to serve as an intentional quantitative tracer for lubricating oil PM emissions. This paper focuses on the detailed chemical speciation of crankcase and tailpipe PM emissions from two school buses used in this study. We found that organic carbon emission rates were generally higher from the crankcase than from the tailpipe for these two school buses, while elemental carbon contributed significantly only in the tailpipe emissions. The n-C36D74 that was added to the engine oil was emitted at higher rates from the crankcase than the tailpipe. Tracers of engine oil (hopanes and steranes) were present in much higher proportion in crankcase emissions. Particle-associated PAH emission rates were generally very low ({\textless}1 Â¼g/km), but more PAH species were present in crankcase than in tailpipe emissions. The speciation of samples collected in the bus cabins was consistent with most of the bus self-pollution originating from crankcase emissions.},

	abstract = {Access to the abdominal cavity is required for diagnostic and therapeutic endeavors for a variety of medical and surgical diseases. Historically, abdominal access has required a formal laparotomy to provide adequate exposure. Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is an emerging experimental alternative to conventional surgery that eliminates abdominal incisions and incision-related complications by combining endoscopic and laparoscopic techniques to diagnose and treat abdominal pathology. During NOTES, commercially available flexible video endoscopes are used to create a controlled transvisceral incision via natural orifice access to enter the peritoneal cavity. Common incision-related complications such as wound infections, incisional hernias, postoperative pain, aesthetic disdain, and adhesions could be minimized or eliminated by NOTES. NOTES has evolved from more than 2 centuries of technological innovations and continued growth in the field of surgical endoscopy. Innovative surgical endoscopists have slowly developed means to surpass the constraints of the gastrointestinal lumen by using a flexible endoscope. The future of surgical endoscopy may be the shared entity of NOTES, which further integrates endoscopy, gastroenterology, and minimally invasive and general surgery. Although the promise of NOTES is electrifying to surgeons and endoscopists, several key issues need to be characterized prior to the incorporation of NOTES into routine practice. This article reviews the status, contemporary body of literature, limitations, and potential future implications accompanying the development of NOTES. 10.1177/1553350606290529},

This would break the physical barrier between bodily trauma and surgery, representing an epical revolution in surgery. Our group at IRCAD-EITS (Institut de Recherche contre les Cancers de l'Appareil Digestif [Institute of Digestive Cancer Research]-European Institute of TeleSurgery) has been actively involved in the development of NOTES since 2004 with a dedicated project created to develop feasibility and survival studies and new endoscopic technology. DESIGN: NOTES cholecystectomy in a woman via a transvaginal approach. SETTING: University hospital. Patient The patient was a 30-year-old woman with symptomatic cholelithiasis. INTERVENTION: The procedure was carried out by a multidisciplinary team using a standard double-channel flexible videogastroscope and standard endoscopic instruments. The placement of a 2-mm needle port, mandatory to insufflate carbon dioxide and to monitor the pneumoperitoneum, was helpful for further retraction of the gallbladder. At no stage of the procedure was there need for laparoscopic assistance. All of the principles of cholecystectomy were strictly adhered to. RESULTS: The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient had no postoperative pain and no scars, and was discharged on the second postoperative day. CONCLUSIONS: Transluminal surgery is feasible and safe. NOTES, a radical shift in the practice and philosophy of interventional treatment, is becoming established and is enormously advantageous to the patient. With its invisible mending and tremendous potential, NOTES might be the next surgical evolution.},

They are suitable for application in the medical field particularly when miniaturization, reliability, and intimate interaction with the human body are required. Medical applications not only motivate the miniaturization of mechatronic systems, but also encourage the development of novel concepts and technologies for the integration of artificial and biological components into \&ldquo;hybrid\&rdquo; micromechatronic systems, thus giving origin to a new and intriguing field of research and application known as \&ldquo;biomechatronics\&rdquo;. Micromechatronic devices can be exploited for acute intervention or for permanent (short- and long-term) implant in the human body. This paper presents many examples of both types of devices being developed in our laboratory, and discusses their associated open problems. Application fields include sensory substitution, internal organs substitution, neural prosthetics, and minimally invasive surgery. Most of the projects are performed in collaboration with other European research groups and industries and supported by programs by the European Union.

A new cost function is proposed for an unconstrained generalized predictive control scheme based on a multiple input-output model of the surgical robot. Contributions of the controller output to the reference tracking task and to the disturbance rejection task are split and computed separately, so that their respective efficiency can be independently weighted. The proposed control scheme is validated through simulations and experimental in vivo results using a surgical robot.},

	abstract = {Advances in surgical technology allow physicians to more effectively provide care to their patients. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized the way a significant number of procedures are performed. Advances in technology have led to the fusion of MIS techniques and robotic devices; however, such systems are currently large and cumbersome. By optimizing a spherical mechanism based on in-vivo data collected during MIS procedures, this paper focuses on a bottom-up approach in developing a new class of surgical robot arms. The spherical mechanism is a rotational manipulator with all axes intersecting at the center of the sphere. Locating the rotational center of the mechanism at the MIS port makes this class of mechanism a suitable candidate for the first two links of a surgical robot for both minimally invasive and open surgery. For optimizing the mechanism structure, the forward and inverse kinematics, as well as the Jacobian matrix, were derived. Using the Jacobian, mechanism isotropy was considered as the performance metric. The dexterous workspace (DWS) is defined as a high dexterity region defined by a right circular cone with a vertex angel of 60\&deg; in which 95\% of the tool motions are contained based on in-vivo measurements. The extended dexterous workspace (EDWS) is defined as the workspace required to reach the entire abdominal cavity with MIS instruments and defined by a cone with an elliptical cross section created by two orthogonal vertex angels of 60\&deg; and 90\&deg;. Optimization across both the DWS and a superset of the EDWS led to a mechanism configuration with link length angles of 74\&deg; and 60\&deg; that maximizes kinematic performance and compactness. The workspace of this design covers the entire EDWS and is the optimal design for the next generation of surgical manipulator. By directly applying in-vivo experimental data from MIS in order to optimize the spherical manipulator a design that maximizes performance and minimizes size has been developed. A pair of prototype manipulators is developed based on these results.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a novel solution for the active locomotion of a miniaturized endoscopic capsule in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In particular, the authors present the design, development, and testing of a legged locomotion system embedded in a capsule (with a volume of about 4-5 cm$^{\textrm{3}}$) and actuated by a brushless minimotor. The actuation mechanism and transmission mechanism are described in detail in order to highlight the compactness of the overall design. This device is provided with four superelastic legs, allowing large stroke advancement in the GI tract, and a CMOS frontal camera, for diagnostic purposes. A dedicated electronic board for controlling the opening angle of the legs and adjusting their speed has been developed. In order to investigate the motion ability of the device, a set of experiments has been carried out. Four different types of superelastic legs have been designed and tested with the objective to identify the best leg configuration for capsule locomotion. Experimental results demonstrate that the device can travel in the digestive tract with a typical speed ranging between 10 and 40 mm/min.},

	abstract = {We have developed a new class of continuously flexible snake-like robots, called active cannulas, that consist of several telescoping pre-curved superelastic tubes. The devices derive bending actuation not from tendon wires or other external mechanisms, but from elastic energy stored in the backbone itself. This allows active cannulas to have a small diameter and a high degree of dexterity, which should enable them to navigate through complex anatomy to sites inaccessible by current surgical robotic devices. Active cannulas may also enhance patient safety because their inherent compliance mitigates potential trauma from inadvertent tool-tissue collision. A consequence of our design is that dexterity improves with miniaturization. A kinematic description of active cannula shape requires a model of the elastic interaction of telescoping pre-curved flexible tubes, and we derive a two-link beam mechanics-based model. Experiments using curved nitinol tubes and wires validate the model},

Robotic-assisted surgery decreases the learning curve in complex laparoscopic surgeries. We hypothesize that robotic-assisted, hand-sewn gastrojejunostomy during a LRYGB will improve results during the initial 100 cases when compared with the literature. METHODS: Our first 100 robotic-assisted gastrojejunostomies performed during LRYGB were reviewed from a prospective database. Patient demographics, operative times, length of stay, reoperations, anastomotic leak, pulmonary embolus, and death were all evaluated. RESULTS: The mean age and body mass index were 42 and 50, respectively. Operative times ranged from 148 minutes to 437 minutes (mean = 254). There were no leaks or deaths. Four patients had complications, including reoperation (1), incisional hernia (1), pulmonary embolus (1), and recurrent umbilical hernia (1).

Data for separation of rigid particles, deformable emulsions, and platelets from whole blood are presented. The system is based upon differential inertial focusing of particles of varying sizes and allows continuous separation based only on intrinsic hydrodynamic forces developed in a flow through an asymmetrically curved channel. A theoretical description of the underlying forces is developed, and in combination with data determining a size cutoff for separation, a semiempirical relationship describing how channel geometry is related to this cutoff is shown. Cascading separations in series is shown to be useful for increasing purity and yield. This type of microfluidic system can filter deformable particles, is largely independent of particle density, and can provide throughputs typical of macroscale filtration in a compact format, enabling applications in blood filtration and particle concentration.},

Excebrane (Terumo Corp, Tokyo, Japan) is a vitamin E-modified cellulose membrane. In the present study, the effect of dialysis with Excebrane membranes on granulocyte and monocyte counts; CD11b, CD11c, and CD45 expression on the surface of granulocytes; and CD14 expression on monocytes was evaluated and compared with low-flux polysulfone membranes. Fifteen minutes after the start of dialysis, granulocytopenia and monocytopenia were more pronounced with the Excebrane membrane compared with polysulfone. The increase in basal expression of CD11b and CD45 on circulating granulocytes was more pronounced during dialysis with Excebrane than polysulfone membranes. Regarding the increased expression on in vitro stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate, blunted upregulation was obtained during dialysis using Excebrane membranes for CD11c and CD45 expression on granulocytes and CD14 expression on monocytes. In conclusion, such indices of membrane bioincompatibility as leukocyte counts and expression of leukocyte surface molecules show more profound alterations with Excebrane than the standard low-flux polysulfone membrane in both basal and in vitro activated states.},

These forces were at an angle of about 40\&\#176; to 70\&\#176; relative to the horizontal plane and approximately 60\&\#176; relative to each other.

In particular, the model considers the distortion effects at the termination nodes and the radial pressure loss due to rubber elasticity. The new model is compared experimentation on a very large actuator and shows how this new model improves the assessment of forces and displacement that can be achieved by the actuator.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is generally recommended for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients who have failed to respond to approved medications. However, few studies of the efficacy of CBT have selected patients who did not respond to medications. METHOD: We selected 20 adult OCD (DSM-IV criteria) patients with a history of inadequate response to adequate doses of multiple medications, as well as a high rate of comorbid disorders. After a 1-month wait-list period, patients received 15 sessions of outpatient CBT incorporating exposure and ritual prevention. RESULTS: OCD severity (as measured with the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale) decreased significantly (p {\textless}.05) after treatment, and gains appeared to have been maintained over a 6-month follow-up period. Analysis of clinical significance indicated that 53\% (8/15) of treatment completers met this criterion at posttreatment and 40\% (6/15) met the criterion at 6-month follow-up. The sample was characterized as having generally poor insight and putting low effort into CBT; these factors significantly (p {\textless}.05) predicted degree of improvement. CONCLUSION: CBT is a useful treatment for OCD patients who have failed to respond adequately to multiple serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications. However, these results were attenuated compared with previous trials. Patients with a long history of poor response to medication may have poor insight and/or not put sufficient effort into treatment; these factors are likely to diminish treatment outcome.},

In particular, extensive molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to understand the effects of surface coverage, chain length, and fluorination on friction and adhesion. Also studied were the effects of interstitial water between the silica substrate and the SAM.},

The enormous promise will not materialize without substantial progress in overcoming the stiction, friction and wear associated with such devices and understanding the mechanical behavior of MEMS materials and structures. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are release and anti-stiction coatings for MEMS. In this paper, the anti-stiction properties of octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) SAM were calculated. The microtribological properties of OTS SAM were investigated with a ball-on-flat microtribometer. The influence of OTS SAM on the mechanical properties of micromachined polysilicon films for MEMS was investigated with an accurate evaluation using the microtensile test device. It was concluded that the OTS SAM has good anti-stiction properties and low friction coefficients. The hydrophobic property of OTS is the main factor leading to an increase in the average fracture strength of micromachined polysilicon up to 32.46\%. Thus, the operational stability and lifetime of MEMS can be raised when coated with self-assembled monolayers.},

	abstract = {In laparoscopic surgery, surgeons perform surgery in the abdominal cavity by using only slender instruments that can be inserted through small diameter trocars. When it is difficult to perform surgery by using only instruments for laparoscopic surgery, they often make a 7-8 cm incision through which their hand can be inserted. Clearly this is invasive compared with complete laparoscopic surgery. This paper proposes an assemblable mechanical hand like a human hand that can be inserted through trocars. We already developed a three-fingered three-degree of freedom assemblable hand. The purpose of this paper is to develop an assemblable hand with more degrees of freedom that can grasp/push aside large internal organs and open membranes. The developed hand has three fingers with a total of five degrees of freedom. Its power transmission mechanisms and assembling method are completely different from those of the previous hand. The hand is assembled from body and finger units with an installation tool. The finger unit is fixed to the body unit with only one screw by using the installation tool. To drive the fingers, power is transmitted with cables, gears and shafts. Experimental results verify that the hand can be assembled in a closed space and that it can grasp and push aside various objects.},

However, excessive damping increases the energy required by an operator for commanding motion. The objective of this paper is to describe a new force reflecting teleoperation methodology that reduces operator energy requirements without sacrificing stability. We begin by describing a new approach to modeling and identifying the remote environment of the teleoperation system. We combine a conventional multi-input, multi-output recursive least squares (MIMO-RLS) system identification, identifying in real-time the remote environment impedance, with a discretized representation of the remote environment. This methodology generates a time-varying, position-dependent representation of the remote environment dynamics. Next, we adapt the target impedance of the master robot with respect to the dynamic model of the remote environment. The environment estimation and impedance adaptation are executed simultaneously and in real time. We demonstrate, through experimentation, that this approach significantly reduces the energy required by an operator to execute remote tasks while simultaneously providing sufficient damping to ensure contact stability.},

This paper presents a mechanics model that includes torsion, applies to any number of tubes and allows curvature and stiffness to vary with arc length. While the general model is comprised of differential equations, an analytic solution is given for two tubes of constant curvature. This solution enables analytic prediction of "snap through" instability based on a single dimensionless parameter. Simulation and experiments are used to illustrate the results.},

Both instrument and robot-assisted ties differ from hand ties in accuracy of applied force. However, only the robot ties differ from hand ties in repeatability of applied force. Furthermore, comparison between attendings and residents revealed statistically significant differences in the forces used during hand ties, although attendings and residents perform similarly when comparing instrument and robot ties to hand ties. These results indicate that resolved force feedback would improve robot-assisted performance during complex surgical tasks such as knot tying with fine suture.},

Based on the new understanding of the configuration space uncovered, this paper then derives the workspace of continuum robots when constrained by actuator length limits. Finally, a tangle/untangle algorithm correctly computes the shape of the distal segments of multisection tendon-actuated continuum robots.

Vectorial rotations of a spatial Eulerâ€“Bernoulli beam have nonlinear relationships with its transverse displacement derivatives [2]. This implies that strictly speaking, the first partial derivative of the strain energy with respect to a transverse displacement derivative is not a bending moment (even if we ignore the axial deformation), and that modifications should be introduced to the conventional Hermitian shape functions employed in the Rayleighâ€“Ritz method of finite element analysis. On the other hand, the neglect of the rotational behaviour of nodal moments has led to an incorrect stability matrix in the literature, and it is shown through numerical examples that this incorrect stability matrix cannot detect the flexural-torsional buckling load of spatial structures in which the members are not connected collinearly. The validity of the Wagner hypothesis on the coupling of axial and torsional deformations for a spatial beam-column is illustrated through a numerical example. Finally, one issue related to the Updated Lagrangian formulation addressed in this paper is the oft-used assumption of a straight configuration at the last known state.},

Though these manipulators prove to be very effective for many tasks, they are not without their limitations, due mainly to their lack of maneuverability or total degrees of freedom. Continuum style (i.e., continuous â€ back-boneâ€) robots, on the other hand, exhibit a wide range of maneuverability, and can have a large number of degrees of freedom. The motion of continuum style robots is generated through the bending of the robot over a given section; unlike traditional robots where the motion occurs in discrete locations, i.e., joints. The motion of continuum manipulators is often compared to that of biological manipulators such as trunks and tentacles. These continuum style robots can achieve motions that could only be obtainable by a conventionally designed robot with many more degrees of freedom. In this paper we present a detailed formulation and explanation of a novel kinematic model for continuum style robots. The design, construction, and implementation of our continuum style robot called the elephant trunk manipulator is presented. Experimental results are then provided to verify the legitimacy of our model when applied to our physical manipulator. We also provide a set of obstacle avoidance experiments that help to exhibit the practical implementation of both our manipulator and our kinematic model. {\textbackslash}copyright 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Many vegans take B-12 supplements irregularly or refuse to adopt them at all, considering them to be "unnatural" products. The use of B-12 fortifi ed food may be an alternative. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the long-term effect of a vegan diet on serum B-12 concentrations in healthy omnivore adults, comparing the infl uence of natural products consumption and B-12 fortifi ed food. Material and methods. A fi ve year prospective study was carried out comprising 20 omnivore healthy adult subjects, who moved to strict vegan diet for 5 years. Ten volunteers followed vegan diet based entirely on natural products, while the remaining ten subjects consumed food fortifi ed in B-12. In all subjects serum vitamin B-12 concentration was determined before and 6, 12, 24 and 60 months after the implementation of the diet. Results. A signifi cant decrease (p {\textless} 0.0002) of serum B-12 concentrations in the whole studied group was noted after 60 months of vegan diet. However, observed changes were in fact limited to the subgroup consuming exclusively natural products (p {\textless} 0.0001). Conclusions. Transition from omnivore to vegan diet is associated with the risk of vitamin B-12 defi ciency.

	abstract = {Background Single-port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS) is a novel surgical approach consisting of a single umbilical incision through which multiple instruments are inserted, thus avoiding additional incisions necessary in traditional multi-port laparoscopic surgery. SPLS imposes a number of ergonomic restrictions on the surgeon. As a partial solution, several dedicated instruments, including hand-held manipulators with 6 degrees of freedom (DOF), have been introduced to overcome these manipulative restrictions. Robotics has the potential to overcome all of the ergonomic restrictions imposed by the SPLS approach. Methods A novel, teleoperated, robotic platform has been developed. SPRINT (Single-Port lapaRoscopy bImaNual roboT) is a multiarm robot enabling bimanual interventions. The robotic arms are introduced into the abdomen through a cylindrical introducer. The surgeon is able to control the robot in a masterâ€“slave configuration through a dedicated console, allowing translation of the surgeon's hand movements to the end-effectors. Results Laboratory tests have been performed with the prototype by experienced surgeons for pick and place and suturing exercises. These confirmed the fast-learning curve with the use of the SPRINT robot. In the pick and place exercise, the mean successful peg transfer rate decreased from 97 s at the start to 50 s required for the transfer of the seventh peg. Thereafter, the slope of the curve decreased to 31 s after 17 transfers. The percentage error rate declined from an initial value 50 \% to 25 \% after 15 pegs had been transferred. In the intracorporeal suture test, needle passage and knot tying were completed by four surgeons in 314 s or less. Conclusions A new surgical robot for SPLS has been developed, and its usability and efficacy have been demonstrated. The SPRINT may pave the way for the next generation of surgical robots, the arms of which are assembled inside the insufflated peritoneal cavity, providing full dexterity and manipulative ability with the SPLS approach.},

This article provides a structured overview of different continuum-mechanical models that have been developed over the years. It aims at facilitating model choice for specific soft tissue modelling applications. According to the complexity of the model, different features of soft biological tissue will be incorporated, i.e. nonlinearity, viscoelasticity, anisotropy, heterogeneity and finally, tissue damage during deformation. A brief summary of experimental methods for material characterisation and an introduction to methods for geometric modelling are also provided. The overview is non-exhaustive, focusing on the most important general models and models with specific biological applications. A trade-off in complexity must be made for enabling real-time simulation, but still maintaining realistic representation of the organ deformation. Depending on the organ and tissue types, different models with emphasis on certain features will prove to be more appropriate, meaning the optimal model choice is organ and tissue-dependent.},

An innovative endoluminal robotic platform for Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS), and more specifically for NOTES, has been developed and tested. The platform is composed of a miniaturized camera robot coupled with an anchoring frame conceived to assure adequate robotic stability inside the abdominal cavity during surgical tasks. The anchoring frame consists of a Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuated magnetic frame attached to the abdominal wall by means of permanent magnets. A dedicated docking mechanism has been integrated in order to assure positioning and anchoring of robotic modules. All platform elements have been specifically designed for NOTES applications: the magnetic frame and the robotic camera module have a diameter of 14 mm and 12 mm respectively. In this work, the endoluminal platform has been illustrated and its potentialities demonstrated in in-vitro conditions on a human phantom.},

In this paper, kinematic control of a snake robot for motion stabilisation under dynamic active constraints is addressed. The main objective is to enable the robot to track the visual target accurately and steadily on deforming tissue whilst conforming to pre-defined anatomical constraints. The motion tracking can also be augmented with manual control. By taking into account the physical limits in terms of maximum frequency response of the system (manifested as a delay between the input of the manipulator and the movement of the end-effector), we show the importance of visual-motor synchronisation for performing accurate smooth pursuit movements. Detailed user experiments are performed to demonstrate the practical value of the proposed control mechanism.

The quantification of animal behavior for research requires that individuals recognize and code the behavior of the animal under study.

Video-based guides offer a method of quantifying behaviors with real-time demonstrations of the components that make up a behavior. An animal behavior encyclopedia has been developed to allow searching and viewing of defined (video-recorded) behaviors on the Internet. This video data base is being developed to initiate a system that automatically extracts animal motion information from an input animal activity video clip using a multiobject tracking and reasoning system. Eventually, the extracted information will be analyzed and described using standard animal behavior definitions (the behavior encyclopedia).

Because knowledge spillovers, cumulative advantage, competition, and collaboration are distinctive features of the academic profession, both the employment relationship and the procedures for assigning recognition and allocating funding should be designed to account for these factors. We study the annual production ni(t) of a given scientist i by analyzing longitudinal career data for 200 leading scientists and 100 assistant professors from the physics community. Our empirical analysis of individual productivity dynamics shows that (i) there are increasing returns for the top individuals within the competitive cohort, and that (ii) the distribution of production growth is a leptokurtic â€ tent-shapedâ€ distribution that is remarkably symmetric. Our methodology is general, and we speculate that similar features appear in other disciplines where academic publication is essential and collaboration is a key feature. We introduce a model of proportional growth which reproduces these two observations, and additionally accounts for the significantly right-skewed distributions of career longevity and achievement in science. Using this theoretical model, we show that short-term contracts can amplify the effects of competition and uncertainty making careers more vulnerable to early termination, not necessarily due to lack of individual talent and persistence, but because of random negative production shocks. We show that fluctuations in scientific production are quantitatively related to a scientist's collaboration radius and team efficiency.},

Currently, diesel PM regulations are based on emitted particle mass; however, the particle size distributions are also important factors in air quality. While the distributions of particulate emissions under steady-state conditions are well-known and have been generalized, varying distributions under transient conditions are not well-understood. This study investigates the size distributions of PM, focusing on the nuclei- and accumulation-modes, emitted from diesel engines under transient operations. Some engine conditions during transient testing produced particle size distributions that were notably different from those produced under steady-state conditions. During transient operation, the size distributions were either mono- or bimodal with peaks that were able to switch quickly between the nuclei- and accumulation-modes. These distributions have not been observed during steady-state testing but are significant because environmental and health effects and emission control solutions are highly dependent on particle size.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The effects of fuel sulfur content and primary dilution on PM number emissions were investigated during transient operations of an old and a modern diesel engine. Emissions were also studied during steady-state operations in order to confirm consistency with previous findings. Testing methods were concurrent with those implemented by the EPA to regulate PM mass emissions, including the use of the Federal Transient Testing Procedure-Heavy Duty cycle to simulate transient conditions and the use of a Critical Flow Venturi-Constant Volume System to provide primary dilution. Steady-state results were found to be consistent with previous studies in that nuclei-mode particulate emissions were largely reduced when lower-sulfur content fuel was used in the newer engine, while the nuclei-mode PM emissions from the older engine were much less affected by fuel sulfur content. The transient results, however, show that the total number of nuclei-mode PM emissions from both engines increases with fuel sulfur content, although this effect is only seen under the higher primary dilution ratios with the older engine. Transient results further show that higher primary dilution ratios increase total nuclei-mode PM number emissions in both engines.},

	abstract = {With increasingly stringent regulations being placed upon engine emissions, an in-depth understanding of engine exhaust composition will be necessary to assess environmental and health impacts and to develop better methods of reducing emission levels. Source sampling systems have commonly utilized partial sampling techniques, which may introduce the potential for particle loss, and steady-state operation, which is incapable of imitating transient engine conditions. In order to simulate atmospheric dilution and aging conditions, maintain proportional sampling throughout temperature excursions during transient operation, and minimize particle loss, while representatively taking multiple samples from the exhaust flow, a full-partial-full source dilution sampling system was developed. The system consists of a critical flow venturi-constant volume system for primary dilution, a thermophoresis-resistant secondary micro-diluter, a residence time chamber, isokinetic sampling probes, multiple sampling trains, and control systems. Further, the system was designed to prevent particle loss and secondary reactions by reducing wall effects, implementing inert materials, optimizing smooth flow transition, and minimizing electrostatic forces. An examination of the system was conducted by performing a tracer study and by determining the variations in flow rates, gaseous concentrations, and PM mass measurements. Further, a statistical analysis was performed to study the capability and performance of the sampling system. The results suggest that the system was capable of collecting similar samples among the sampling trains and displaying sufficient agreement with a certification system. Therefore, the source dilution sampling system developed in this study is suitable for collecting representative samples from an exhaust flow under transient or steady-state conditions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the in vitro stability of two cemented hip stem designs: Stem I was a collarless, double-tapered, highly polished implant; Stem II had a collar and matt finish. BACKGROUND: Stability of the femoral component of a hip implant is important for its long-term clinical success. Excessive migration or cyclic motion can increase the risk of early implant failure. METHODS: The stems were implanted in paired human cadaver femurs, and custom-designed micromotion sensors were used to measure three-dimensional motions of the stems at proximal, middle and distal locations during simulated in vivo loading cycles. RESULTS: This study found that despite 'rigid' fixation, cemented stems exhibit detectable motions under a limited number of cycles of simulated physiologic loads. At four times the donor body weight, Stem I showed a subsidence of 90 microm, compared to 25 microm of Stem II (P{\textless}0.05). In contrast, the proximal end of Stem II exhibited greater cyclic motions in the medial-lateral direction (P{\textless}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The different motion patterns could be due to the design differences, such as surface finish and geometry.RelevanceImplant design is an important factor related to the behavior of the cement/bone interface and the overall success of the implant. This study compares in vitro micromotion of two cemented femoral prostheses with differing proximal designs.},

	abstract = {Abstract: A dilution source sampling system is augmented to measure the size-distributed chemical composition of fine particle emissions from motor vehicles. Measurements are made using an optical particle counter (OPC), a differential mobility analyzer (DMA)/condensation nucleus counter (CNC) combination, and a pair of microorifice uniform deposit impactors (MOUDIs). The sources tested with this system include catalyst-equipped gasoline-powered light-duty vehicles, noncatalyst gasoline-powered light-duty vehicles, and medium-duty diesel trucks. Chemical composition analysis demonstrates that particles emitted from the gasoline-powered vehicles tested are largely composed of organic compounds while particles emitted from diesel engines contain roughly equal amounts of organic compounds and elemental carbon. The particle mass distributions from all mobile sources tested have a single mode that peaks at approximately 0.1-0.2 m particle diameter. Of the two diesel vehicles tested, the vehicle with the lowest fine particle emissions rate released the largest number of ultrafine particles, a finding similar to that of Bagley et al. (Characterization of fuel and aftertreatment device effects on diesel emissions; Technical Report 76; Health Effects Institute: Cambridge, MA, 1996). Particle size distribution measurements taken throughout the FTP urban driving cycle used to test all of the vehicles described in this paper reveal that particulate mass emission rates and particulate size distributions from the vehicles tested here are similar during the cold start and hot start segments of the driving cycle.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Particulate matter emissions from a series of different Chinese coal combustion systems were collected and analyzed for elemental and organic carbon (EC, OC), and molecular markers. Emissions from both industrial boilers and residential stoves were investigated. The coal used in this study included anthracite, bituminite, and brown coal, as well as commonly used coal briquettes produced in China for residential coal combustion. Results show significant differences in the contribution of carbonaceous species to particulate mass emissions. Industrial boilers had much higher burn out of carbon yielding particulate matter emissions with much lower levels of OC, EC, and speciated organic compounds, while residential stoves had significantly higher emissions of carbonaceous particulate matter with emission rates of approximately 100 times higher than that of industrial boilers. Quantified organic compounds emitted from industrial boilers were dominated by oxygenated compounds, of which 46⬚68\% were organic acids, whereas the dominate species quantified in the emissions from residential stoves were PAHs (38\%) and n-alkanes (20\%). An important observation was the fact that emission factors of PAHs and the distribution of hopanoids were different among the emissions from industrial and residential coal combustion even using the same coal for combustion. Although particulate matter emissions from industrial and residential combustion were different in many regards, picene was detected in all samples with detectable OC mass concentrations, which supports the use of this organic tracer for OC from all types of coal combustion. 17Â±(H),21Â²(H)-29-norhopane was the predominant hopanoid in coal combustion emissions, which is different from mobile source emissions and may be used to distinguish emissions from these different fossil fuel sources.},

Observed weekly trends in elemental carbon (EC), hopanes, steranes, and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) indicate increased impacts of motor vehicle traffic on carbonaceous particulate matter concentrations on weekdays relative to weekends. Ambient average EC was approximately 4 times higher in the Friday samples than in Sunday samples at each site. Levoglucosan, a tracer species for biomass burning, and cholesterol, monopalmitin, and monostearin, tracers for food cooking operations, were all highest on Friday and lowest on Sunday. Late-week increases in aliphatic and aromatic diacids present in the particulate phase were also observed. Diacids in particulate matter have been seen to be indicators of secondary organic aerosol formation, and the day-of-week trend observed may be due to weekday increases in volatile precursor species present in the atmosphere.},

The sensitivity of positive matrix factorization to small perturbations in species measurement uncertainty estimates is examined using fine particulate matter measurements on organic carbon, elemental carbon, ions, and metals at the St. Louis⬚Midwest Supersite. A perturbed uncertainty matrix is created by multiplying each original uncertainty value by a random multiplier generated from a log-normal distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation (and CV) equal to either 0.25, 0.50, or 0.75. The relative errors in reproducing the average contribution estimates from the perturbed data are generally highest for the gasoline exhaust, with the relative error (expressed as a percentage of the ⬚true⬚ value) exceeding 30\% for all three perturbation scenarios. The most stable estimates of average source contribution were associated with secondary sulfate and secondary nitrate, with relative errors always less than 4\%. Averaged over all 10 sources, the average values for our measure of relative error for the three scenarios are 8\%, 14\%, and 17\%, respectively. Relative errors associated with day-to-day estimates of source contributions can be more than double the size of the relative errors associated with estimates of average source contributions, with errors for four of 10 source contributions exceeding 30\% for the largest-perturbation scenario. The stability of source profile estimates in our simulation varies greatly between sources, with a mean correlation between perturbed gasoline exhaust profiles and the true profile equal to only 59\% for the largest-perturbation scenario. The process used for evaluation is a tool that may be used to assess the stability of solutions in source apportionment studies.},

	abstract = {A computational simulation method for three-dimensional trabecular surface remodeling was proposed, using voxel finite element models of cancellous bone, and was applied to the experimental data. In the simulation, the trabecular microstructure was modeled based on digital images, and its morphological changes due to surface movement at the trabecular level were directly expressed by removing/adding the voxel elements from/to the trabecular surface. A remodeling simulation at the single trabecular level under uniaxial compressive loading demonstrated smooth morphological changes even though the trabeculae were modeled with discrete voxel elements. Moreover, the trabecular axis rotated toward the loading direction with increasing stiffness, simulating functional adaptation to the applied load. In the remodeling simulation at the trabecular structural level, a cancellous bone cube was modeled using a digital image obtained by microcomputed tomography (microCT), and was uniaxially compressed. As a result, the apparent stiffness against the applied load increased by remodeling, in which the trabeculae reoriented to the loading direction. In addition, changes in the structural indices of the trabecular architecture coincided qualitatively with previously published experimental observations. Through these studies, it was demonstrated that the newly proposed voxel simulation technique enables us to simulate the trabecular surface remodeling and to compare the results obtained using this technique with the in vivo experimental data in the investigation of the adaptive bone remodeling phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Catastrophic failure of tibial baseplates due to fatigue fracture have occurred in patients. The International Standards Organisation (ISO) have proposed an endurance test to ensure a safety level for trays with respect to this problem. At present the magnitude of the applied load has not been defined. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ISO test by comparing the results of two tibial trays: one with a clinical history of fracture of the tibial baseplate in some cases (Kinematic) and one without such a record (Kinemax). A load of 2000 N was selected, representing the peak force during the normal walking cycle. Finite element analysis (FEA) predicted that both the Kinematic and Kinemax trays would rapidly fail for two defined contact positions. Mechanical testing performed on both these components confirmed the FEA predictions. However, under service conditions, the Kinematic tray has been reported to have a failure of only 1-2\%, the failure occurring at a mean of 54 months for early fracture and 7 years for late fracture. There are no published reports of failed Kinemax trays. It is concluded that the ISO test is an exaggeration of reality when a physiological load is used. As a result of our study we propose that a load of 500 N would effectively screen components with respect to the ISO test conditions for the likelihood of fracture.},

	volume = {8},
	abstract = {To determine the adverse effects on the implant/cement interface stresses caused by a dynamic load on the implant, an axisymmetric dynamic finite element analysis was performed for an idealized knee tibial component assuming perfect bonding at the interface. The component, consisting of a metal plate with a central stem, was subjected to a compressive load that varied with time as a terminated ramp function. At first, the reliability of the interface stress predictions was assessed by computing the effects of a number of method-related parameters, viz., the finite element mesh density, the assumed bone properties. Analysis was then performed considering the stem length, cement mantle thickness, and the type of implant metal as design variables. The analysis predicts high-frequency (600 Hz) stress oscillations of significant amplitude at those locations of the interface that are also subjected to high static stresses: near the stem-plate junction and the stem tip for normal stress, and at the stem tip for shear stress. However, the predicted stress amplitude has been found to be particularly sensitive to the assumed rise time of the input load function. With a rise time of 2.0 ms, an input condition considered to be severe enough to represent the most vigorous dynamic activity, the maximum stress augmentation, because of stress oscillations, is predicted to be less than 25\%. In general, the design variables have been found to affect the static stresses much more than the dynamic ones. It has been concluded that for the cases studied, dynamic effects are relatively small and a static analysis is sufficient to characterize the interface stress condition},

RSA is now considered the benchmark for quantifying implant migration in clinical studies of total joint replacement, yet its use in preclinical animal models has not been widely reported. The same attributes that make RSA appealing as an analytical method in humans (i.e., high precision and accuracy, noninvasiveness, objectivity) also make it a promising option for animal studies. The specific aims of this study were to determine the technical feasibility and analytical precision of RSA in a canine model of cemented total hip replacement. The precision of RSA was assessed in (1) a Plexiglas phantom, (2) a canine Sawbone model, and (3) a pilot series of dogs implanted with cemented canine THR implants. In vitro precision values, calculated as the 95\% confidence limits for the error between duplicate RSA examinations, ranged from 4.3 to 17.9 microm for translation and from 0.01 degrees to 0.22 degrees for rotation. In vivo precision values ranged from 16.2 to 41.1 microm for translation and 0.17 degrees to 0.44 degrees for rotation. As is the case in humans, RSA appears to provide an order-of-magnitude improvement in technical precision as compared to plain film X-ray. RSA can therefore be considered a practical and potentially valuable noninvasive outcome measure for assessing implant function in canine cemented THR.},

The objectives of this study were to develop and validate a realistic FE model of the pelvis using subject-specific estimates of bone geometry, location-dependent cortical thickness and trabecular bone elastic modulus, and to assess the sensitivity of FE strain predictions to assumptions regarding cortical bone thickness as well as bone and cartilage material properties. A FE model of a cadaveric pelvis was created using subject-specific computed tomography image data. Acetabular loading was applied to the same pelvis using a prosthetic femoral stem in a fashion that could be easily duplicated in the computational model. Cortical bone strains were monitored with rosette strain gauges in ten locations on the left hemipelvis. FE strain predictions were compared directly with experimental results for validation. Overall, baseline FE predictions were strongly correlated with experimental results (r2=0.824), with a best-fit line that was not statistically different than the line y=x (experimental strains = FE predicted strains). Changes to cortical bone thickness and elastic modulus had the largest effect on cortical bone strains. The FE model was less sensitive to changes in all other parameters. The methods developed and validated in this study will be useful for creating and analyzing patient-specific FE models to better understand the biomechanics of the pelvis.},

The patella, tibia and femur epiphyseal region and immediate subchondral area were analysed for bone density at all ages. We found that both radiological and histological osteoarthritis scores increased progressively for the Dunkin-Hartley, but not for the BS2 demonstrating its value as a control. The Dunkin-Hartley had a higher bone density and greater subchondral bone thickness from 24 weeks of age. We conclude that prior to any gross osteoarthritis pathology the Dunkin-Hartley are undergoing subchondral bone remodelling, thus demonstrating the fundamental role of early bone remodelling in the development of osteoarthritis.},

	abstract = {In this study, we compared bone blood flow values obtained by simultaneously injected fluorescent (FM) and radiolabeled microspheres (RM) at stepwise reduced arterial blood pressure. Ten anesthetized female New Zealand White rabbits received simultaneous left ventricular injections of FM and RM at 90, 70, and 50 mmHg mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). After the experiments, both kidneys and long bones of all four limbs were removed and dissected in a standardized manner. Radioactivity (corrected for decay, background, and spillover) and fluorescence were determined, and blood flow values were calculated. Relative blood flow values estimated for each bone sample by RM and FM were significantly correlated (r = 0.98, slope = 0.99, and intercept = 0.04 for 90 mmHg; r = 0.98, slope = 0.94, and intercept = 0.09 for 70 mmHg; r = 0.98, slope = 0.96, and intercept = 0.07 for 50 mmHg). Blood flow values (ml x min-1 x 100 g-1) of right and left bone samples determined at the different arterial blood pressures were identical. During moderate hypotension (70 mmHg MAP), blood flow in all bone samples remained unchanged compared with 90 mmHg MAP, whereas a significant decrease of bone blood flow was observed at severe hypotension (50 mmHg MAP). Our results demonstrate that the FM technique is valid for measuring bone blood flow. Differences in bone blood flow during altered hemodynamic conditions can be detected reliably. In addition, changes in bone blood flow during hypotension indicate that vasomotor control mechanisms, as well as cardiac output, play a role in setting bone blood flow.},

The motivations were: to select a suitable bone substitute for standardized testing of glenoid prosthesis loosening, to assist in shoulder prosthesis design and to provide input data for finite element analyses. Ten glenoids from eight cadavers (mean age, 81) were tested by in situ indentation. Mean strength ranged from 6.7 to 17 MPa for the ten glenoids, the overall mean being 10.3 MPa. Mean E moduli ranged from 67 to 171 MPa for the individual glenoids, the overall mean being 99 MPa. These values are likely at the lower end of what would be expected for normal bone since strength and modulus decrease with age and the available specimens were older. These values may be appropriate for prosthesis design, however, since mechanical properties are reduced in rheumatoid arthritic bone. Regional trends were very similar for modulus and strength. The strongest region was postero-superior. The central column, correlating with the keel position in many glenoid components, was weaker than both the anterior and posterior regions but deeper. A large drop in strength and modulus below the subchondral layer emphasizes the importance of maintaining this layer during prosthetic replacement.},

After initial micromotion testing to 2250 N in simulated single leg stance and stair climb, six of each stem type were loaded dynamically for 1 million cycles at 950 N at 1 Hz. Micromotion studies were repeated. The two stem types had similar micromotion. For the single leg stance, fully cemented implant motion averaged (+/- 95\% confidence) 18 +/- 8 microns toggle, 41 +/- 5 microns axial, and 59 +/- 22 microns rotation. Proximally cemented implant motion averaged 20 +/- 6 microns toggle, 42 +/- 6 microns axial, and 31 +/- 15 microns rotation. For the simulated stair climb, fully cemented implant motion averaged 24 +/- 10 microns toggle, 45 +/- 8 microns axial, and 92 +/- 32 microns rotation. Proximally cemented implant motion averaged 19 +/- 10 microns toggle, 42 +/- 9 microns axial, and 87 +/- 53 microns rotation. For both loading conditions, there were no significant differences measurable between the two systems. After dynamic testing of the fully cemented implants, there were no significant changes in the micromotion of either the toggle or the rotation, but an average of 18 microns increase of axial motion was measured in the fully cemented stem. For the proximally cemented implants, there were no significant changes after dynamic testing. This differences was not considered clinically significant because roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis studies have shown that more than 4 mm of migration is required before clinical symptoms manifest.

This difference may be related to differences in the structure and mechanics of both cells and extracellular matrix, which are expected to cause differences in the physical stimuli (such as pressure, stress, and strain) in the cellular micromechanical environment. In this study, a finite element model was developed that was capable of describing the cell micromechanical environment in the intervertebral disc. The model was capable of describing a number of important mechanical phenomena: flow-dependent viscoelasticity using the biphasic theory for soft tissues; finite deformation effects using a hyperelastic constitutive law for the solid phase; and material anisotropy by including a fiber-reinforced continuum law in the hyperelastic strain energy function. To construct accurate finite element meshes, the in situ geometry of IVD cells were measured experimentally using laser scanning confocal microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction techniques. The model predicted that the cellular micromechanical environment varies dramatically between the anatomic zones, with larger cellular strains predicted in the anisotropic anulus fibrosus and transition zone compared to the isotropic nucleus pulposus. These results suggest that deformation related stimuli may dominate for anulus fibrosus and transition zone cells, while hydrostatic pressurization may dominate in the nucleus pulposus. Furthermore, the model predicted that micromechanical environment is strongly influenced by cell geometry, suggesting that the geometry of IVD cells in situ may be an adaptation to reduce cellular strains during tissue loading.},

This single-surgeon series, with no loss to follow-up, provides reliable data of the revision rates of one of the most commonly-used total knee replacements.

This study evaluates in vitro the initial stability of the CLU prototype under torsional load, in comparison with cemented and cementless stems. The results show that the CLU stem is very stable in simulated stair climbing. Its micromotions are comparable to those of a cemented prosthesis, and significantly less (80-90\% lower) than those for a cementless stem. These findings confirm the optimal initial stability expected from the CLU prototype.

Fifteen competing tray designs with various degrees of flange curvature were assessed with the aim of minimizing bone-tray shear micromotion. A trade-off was found between reducing micromotion and increasing peripheral cancellous bone stresses.

	abstract = {In patients with deficient bone in the proximal end of the tibia, the mechanical support of a conventional total knee replacement may be inadequate. We have developed a custom design for use in situations in which there is extensive deficiency of tibial cancellous bone. To do this, we examined conventional and custom prosthetic tibial components using finite-element analysis. Several loading configurations were tested, and the worst loading conditions were found to be those in which eccentric loads were placed on the margin of the tibial component. The results showed that the stresses on the cancellous bone beneath a conventional-design prosthesis may be lowered if a metal tray and metal peg are employed. A salvage-design concept for revision in the presence of deficient cancellous bone was tested analytically and used successfully. This concept requires that some portion of the applied load be transferred directly to the tibial cortical shell. Stresses in the remaining cancellous bone were lowered by the combination of a thickened metal tray and a metal support buttress. Clinical Relevance: This study demonstrates the advantage of metal trays for the tibial plateau and suggests that they should be used whenever the supporting tibial bone is insufficient. In knees in which there are large defects in the bone, direct transfer of the load to the cortical shell through the prosthesis, made possible by a custom design, appears to be necessary.},

The greatest differences among designs was for the von Mises strain, which reached its maximum beneath the surface.

	volume = {28},
	abstract = {Although the clinical results of total joint arthroplasty are usually excellent, some implants develop loosening and require revision. Implants usually fail by a combination of mechanisms, but different basic designs tend to show different dominant mechanisms of failure. Infection causes failure of about 1-5\% of cases of primary arthroplasty. Clues to the presence of infection include clinical signs, a periosteal reaction, a positive culture of aspirated joint fluid, and acute inflammation identified in tissue around the implant. There are several different mechanisms and modes of implant wear, and perhaps the most important cause of aseptic loosening is an inflammatory reaction to particles of wear debris. Abrasive, adhesive, and fatigue wear of polyethylene, metal and bone cement produces debris particles that induce bone resorption and implant loosening. Particles can cause linear, geographic, or erosive patterns of bone resorption (osteolysis), the distributions of which are influenced by the implant design. Micromotion of implants that did not achieve adequate initial fixation is another important mechanism of loosening. Fatigue failure at the bone/cement and bone/implant interface may cause aseptic loosening, and may be especially important for implants with relatively smooth surfaces. Stress shielding can influence local bone density, but is rarely an isolated cause of implant loosening. Elevated hydrodynamic pressure has been associated with bone resorption in the absence of implants, and may also play a role in implant loosening.},

In addition, the use of two different coordinate systems to gauge translation on a radiographic anterior-posterior (A-P) knee laxity exam resulted in a significant correlation (R(2)=0.562) between the two systems; however, differences of up 9.28mm were found between corresponding measurements. This implies that clinical conclusions can potentially be upheld or refuted, based on the same data set, subject to coordinate system definition.

Using techniques previously established to compare polyethylene particles from hip simulators to those from retrieved tissues, particles isolated from six revised posterior stabilized knee replacements were characterized and compared to particles generated from the same knee design worn in a knee simulator. The particles produced in the knee simulator were of comparable size but had less variability in their form factor compared to the particles produced in vivo. Comparable wear features were seen on the articulating surfaces in both groups. These results indicate that this knee joint simulator is able to reproduce a baseline type of wear that is similar to that in vivo and should encourage further use of this device to better understand knee component wear and function.},

	abstract = {In a companion paper, we presented a time-dependent theory for bone modeling and remodeling in response to a daily loading history. This paper represents a preliminary attempt to use the theory to determine the distribution of bone density within the adult proximal femur under an assumed normal loading history. Subsequent functional adaptation of the internal structure due to changes in the loading history are then determined. Throughout this preliminary study, the external geometry of the proximal femur is considered to be fixed, i.e., changes in the external shape are neither stimulated nor allowed. Linear and trilinear (dead-zone nonlinearity) rate remodeling laws were compared. Computer emulations using two-dimensional finite element models were successful in creating a normal-appearing distribution of bone tissue when remodeling was initiated from a solid structure of homogeneous bone density. Subsequent reduction in the loading history caused regional bone atrophy. Reinstatement of the normal loading history caused a generalized increase in bone mass but resulted in a slightly different bone distribution than was calculated for a constant loading history. These results demonstrate the utility of the remodeling theory and are consistent with the hypothesis that similar stress-related phenomena are responsible for both normal morphogenesis and functional adaptation in response to changes in the bone loading.},

	abstract = {The primary stability of cementless acetabular components is a prerequisite for their clinical success. The target of the present study was to analyse possible effects of post-operative joint loading on the initial mechanical stability of a press-fitted acetabular prosthesis. For this purpose, a three-dimensional finite element model of the pelvic bone with acetabular reconstruction was set-up. The analysis included two steps: (1) simulation of the prosthesis press-fit implantation and (2) simulation of the instant of peak resultant hip loading during the one-legged stance. The difference between the contact pressures at the bone/implant interface, at the end of the second step and those at the end of the first step was calculated and assumed as an index of variation in mechanical contact due to post-operative weight bearing. The results show that, due to hip loading, contact pressures given by press-fit increase in the postero-superior acetabular region but decrease in the antero-inferior acetabular region. The calculated area in which the contact pressures decrease extend to about 30\% of the total contact surface. These results imply that post-operative joint loading significantly reduces the mechanical stability given by press-fit. The decrease in contact pressures at the bone/implant interface may result in a lack of osteointegration, possibly hindering the implant secondary stability. It may also create a route for wear debris, possibly favouring periprosthetic osteolysis, which may lead to further loss in contact and clinical failure of the implant due to loosening.},

	abstract = {The development of theoretical failure, fatigue, and wear models for ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) used in joint replacements has been hindered by the lack of a validated constitutive model that can accurately predict large deformation mechanical behavior under clinically relevant, multiaxial loading conditions. Recently, a new Hybrid constitutive model for unirradiated UHMWPE was developed Bergström et al., (Biomaterials 23 (2002) 2329) based on a physics-motivated framework which incorporates the governing micro-mechanisms of polymers into an effective and accurate continuum representation. The goal of the present study was to compare the predictive capability of the new Hybrid model with the J2-plasticity model for four conventional and highly crosslinked UHMWPE materials during multiaxial loading. After calibration under uniaxial loading, the predictive capabilities of the J2-plasticity and Hybrid model were tested by comparing the load-displacement curves from experimental multiaxial (small punch) tests with simulated load-displacement curves calculated using a finite element model of the experimental apparatus. The quality of the model predictions was quantified using the coefficient of determination (r2). The results of the study demonstrate that the Hybrid model outperforms the J2-plasticity model both for combined uniaxial tension and compression predictions and for simulating multiaxial large deformation mechanical behavior produced by the small punch test. The results further suggest that the parameters of the HM may be generalizable for a wide range of conventional, highly crosslinked, and thermally treated UHMWPE materials, based on the characterization of four material properties related to the elastic modulus, yield stress, rate of strain hardening, and locking stretch of the polymer chains. Most importantly, from a practical perspective, these four key material properties for the Hybrid constitutive model can be measured by relatively simple uniaxial tension or compression tests.},

	abstract = {Physicians routinely discuss pulmonary function and its impact on prognosis or operative risk. Although many studies have related various measures of pulmonary function to postoperative outcome, there has been no study designed to determine which of the spirometric measures of pulmonary function tests reflects the actual abstract idea of pure pulmonary function. A homogeneous population of 70 male patients was subjected to pulmonary function tests and a simple stair climb. Measures of pulmonary function (including FEV1, FEV1\%, FVC, FVC\%, and MVV\%) were factor analyzed in a measurement model of pulmonary function to obtain reliability and validity estimates in predicting performance on a simple stair-climb test. The analysis revealed several interesting aspects concerning the relative importance of the various spirometric measures of pulmonary function tests. The validity estimates of the pulmonary function measures were as follows: FEV1\% = 0.917; FEV1 = 0.886; MVV\% = 0.769; FVC\% = 0.715; FVC = 0.694. Analysis indicates that the FEV1\% was the single best spirometric indicator of pulmonary function when predicting the physiologic outcome (followed closely by the FEV1). In addition, the various spirometric measures of pulmonary function were not equally valid nor interchangeable in such analysis. Although the number of stairs climbed correlates well with pulmonary function (r = 0.626), the coefficient of non-determination (i.e., 1-r2) suggests that about 61\% of the performance on the stair climb may be explained by other parameters (i.e., cardiac function, determination, altitude, etc.).},

In this study, we have identified an adaptation of Mov13 skeletal tissue that significantly improves the bending strength of long bone. The adaptive response occurred over a 2-mo period, during which time a small number of newly proliferated osteogenic cells produced a significant amount of matrix components and thus generated new bone along periosteal surfaces.

We obtained 31 intact cadaveric feet from the local anatomic gifts program, including 13 men and 18 women, with a mean age of 77 years (range 50-91 years). Broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) and ultrasound transit velocity (SOS) were assessed in the intact cadaveric feet using a water-based ultrasound system. In addition, we measured the bone mineral density (BMD) of the posterior calcaneus using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Cubes of trabecular bone were then removed from the calcaneus at approximately the same location as the QUS measurements were obtained, and the elastic modulus and ultimate strength of the trabecular bone specimens were measured by compressing them in the mediolateral direction. We found that QUS variables were moderately to strongly correlated with the mechanical properties of calcaneal trabecular bone (r2 = 0.48-0.63, p {\textless} 0.001 for all). However, the strongest associations with the mechanical properties trabecular bone were provided by calcaneus BMD and trabecular bone apparent density (r2 = 0.66-0.88). BUA and densitometric measurements were independently associated with elastic modulus, but not with ultimate strength. Our results indicate that QUS measurements of the intact heel are associated with the mechanical properties of calcaneal trabecular bone and, in some cases, provide information in addition to that provided by BMD or density measurements.},

	abstract = {Repetitive, low-intensity loading from normal daily activities can generate fatigue damage in trabecular bone, a potential cause of spontaneous fractures of the hip and spine. Finite element models of trabecular bone (Guo et al., 1994) suggest that both creep and slow crack growth contribute to fatigue failure. In an effort to characterize these damage mechanisms experimentally, we conducted fatigue and creep tests on 85 waisted specimens of trabecular bone obtained from 76 bovine proximal tibiae. All applied stresses were normalized by the previously measured specimen modulus. Fatigue tests were conducted at room temperature; creep tests were conducted at 4, 15, 25, 37, 45, and 53 degrees C in a custom-designed apparatus. The fatigue behavior was characterized by decreasing modulus and increasing hysteresis prior to failure. The hysteresis loops progressively displaced along the strain axis, indicating that creep was also involved in the fatigue process. The creep behavior was characterized by the three classical stages of decreasing, constant, and increasing creep rates. Strong and highly significant power-law relationships were found between cycles-to-failure, time-to-failure, steady-state creep rate, and the applied loads. Creep analyses of the fatigue hysteresis loops also generated strong and highly significant power law relationships for time-to-failure and steady-state creep rate. Lastly, the products of creep rate and time-to-failure were constant for both the fatigue and creep tests and were equal to the measured failure strains, suggesting that creep plays a fundamental role in the fatigue behavior of trabecular bone. Additional analysis of the fatigue strain data suggests that creep and slow crack growth are not separate processes that dominate at high and low loads, respectively, but are present throughout all stages of fatigue.},

	abstract = {There are almost no published data that describe the creep behavior of trabecular bone (at the specimen level), even though the creep behavior of cortical bone has been well documented. In an effort to characterize the creep behavior of trabecular bone and to compare it with that of cortical bone, we performed uniaxial compressive creep tests on 24 cylindrical specimens of trabecular bone taken from 19 bovine proximal tibiae. Six different load levels were used, with the applied stress normalized by the specimen modulus measured prior to creep loading. We found that trabecular bone exhibits the three creep regimens (primary, secondary, and tertiary) associated with metals, ceramics, and cortical bone. All specimens eventually fractured at strains less than 3.8\%. In addition, the general shape of the creep curve was independent of apparent density. Strong and highly significant power law relationships (r2 {\textgreater} 0.82, p {\textless} 0.001) were found between the normalized stress sigma/E0 and both time-to-failure tf and steady-state creep rate d epsilon/dt: tf = 9.66 x 10(-33) (sigma/E0)-16.18; d epsilon/dt = 2.21 x 10(33) (sigma/E0)17.65. These data indicate that the creep behaviors of trabecular and cortical bone are qualitatively similar. In addition, the strength of trabecular bone can be reduced substantially if relatively large stresses (i.e. stresses approximately half the ultimate strength) are applied for 5 h. Such strength reductions may play a role in the etiology of progressive, age-related spine fractures if adaptive bone remodeling does not arrest creep deformations.},

It is based on dual instrumented cantilever arms that measure the difference in tip-to-tip deflection. The so-called extensometer device was compared to two standard methods of measuring strain based on platen measurements. The extensometer device output was highly linear with tip deflection (r(2){\textgreater}0.99), and contact of the devices with the specimen was optimized by using an axial distribution of three devices fixed in a free-floating jig. Deflection of the extensometer arms was accurate to 4.8 microm, and precision was between 2-5 microm. Tests included measuring rubber test specimens and cylindrical cancellous bone cores extracted from canine femoral condyles. A trend of decreasing apparent modulus with decreasing strain rate was evident with the extensometer technique. Correlation between the extensometer method and the other two methods was r(2)=0.55. The measure of mid-substance strain avoids non-linearities in the compression tests caused by early failure at the specimen ends, and the uniaxial testing conditions result in boundary conditions that are well suited for subsequent finite element analysis.},

Fourteen of the implants were posterior-stabilized press-fit condylar systems and 13 were cruciate-retaining press-fit condylar systems. The articular track areas were examined using a digital camera and manual measurements. Findings revealed the track area in posterior-stabilized implants (93\%) was larger than in cruciate-retaining implants (59\%). Mean posterior distance ratio of the articular track from the posterior limit of the polyethylene was 2\% (.08 cm) for posterior-stabilized implants versus 23\% (.97 cm) for cruciate-retaining implants. No differences in wear rating were noted. The pattern of articular contact in cruciate-retaining knees demonstrated little migration of the femoral contact surface across the tibial polyethylene plateau.},

	volume = {22},
	abstract = {Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) has been used extensively to evaluate the magnitude and direction of penetration of the femoral head into the acetabular component of a total hip replacement as a result of polyethylene wear and creep. The accuracy and precision of an RSA study depends on several factors, including the radiographic technique, the analytical software, and the positioning of the tantalum markers. This study had three sequential purposes. First, an in vitro phantom model was used to quantify the accuracy and precision of digital images versus conventional radiography in RSA measurements of penetration of the femoral head into the acetabular shell in a total hip replacement. The Umea RSA software package was used for analysis of both the conventional films, which were digitized at a resolution of 300 DPI, and digital radiographs, which were converted from a DICOM format at a resolution of 218 DPI. Digital radiography was found to be superior. Next, two methods of RSA analysis currently in use for determining femoral head penetration into polyethylene of total joint replacements were compared. Using the phantom model, we compared the Umea RSA system (Biomedical Innovations AB) to the RSA-CMS (RSA Clinical Measurement Solution) and in both cases used the digital radiographs. The Umea RSA system was found to be superior. Finally, two methods of marking the position of the acetabular component with tantalum beads were compared: one in which beads were inserted into previously described towers protruding from the back of the acetabular shell and another in which beads were placed into the peripheral flange of the polyethylene liner using the Umea RSA analysis system of the digital radiographs. The results using the two marker configurations were similar.},

Liquid metal strain gauges were used to measure the motion between the tibial component and bone at four locations in eight cadaver tibia at near-point cyclic loads ranging from 10 to 2,000 N. Two types of motion were observed: inducible displacement, which is reversible, followed the oscillating load and occurred in both cemented and uncemented tests, and liftoff or separation of the component and bone, which occurred only for the noncemented cases and remained even after removal of the load. For both motion types, noncemented tests exhibited significant (P less than .05) and dramatic increased interface motion compared to the cemented cases for all load types. The results suggest that the magnitudes of implant-bone interface separation at loads in the low physiologic range for noncemented implants can be sufficiently large to inhibit bony ingrowth into a prosthesis with an average pore size of 300 microns.},

Cell deformations are predicted from detailed nonlinear FE analysis of the microstructure, consisting of an arrangement of cells embedded in matrix material. Effective macroscopic tissue behavior is derived by a computational homogenization procedure. To illustrate this approach, we simulated the compression of a skeletal muscle tissue construct and studied the influence of microstructural heterogeneity on local cell deformations. Results show that heterogeneity has a profound impact on local cell deformations, which highly exceed macroscopic deformations. Moreover, microstructural heterogeneity and the presence of neighboring cells leads to complex cell shapes and causes non-uniform deformations within a cell.},

The vertical deflections of the medial and lateral sides of the tray relative to the bone were measured while bending of the stem was recorded with strain gauges. The greatest deflections occurred when cement alone filled the defect; only slight improvement resulted from the addition of two cancellous screws to buttress the metal tray. Further improvement occurred when solid spacers of Plexiglas or metal were used. Finally, the most secure support was obtained with an integral custom-made tibial component. A central stem 70 mm long carried 23\%-38\% of the axial load, considered useful in the situation of deficient proximal bone. A metal wedge was considered an acceptable alternative to a custom-made component and may prove useful in the reconstruction of tibial bone stock defects.},

There are no consistently effective methods for preventing osteoarthritis or slowing its progression, and symptomatic treatments provide limited benefit for many patients. Osteoarthritis disables about 10\% of people who are older than 60 years, compromises the quality of life of more than 20 million Americans, and costs the United States economy more than \$60 billion per year. The incidence of osteoarthritis rises precipitously with age; as a result, the prevalence and burden of this disorder is increasing rapidly. Study of the patterns osteoarthritis incidence and prevalence shows that it occurs frequently in the hand, foot, knee, spine and hip, but rarely in the ankle, wrist, elbow, and shoulder, and the most important universal risk factors are age, excessive joint loading, and joint injury. Analysis of the impact of osteoarthritis raises questions that include: Why does the incidence increase progressively with age? Why are some joints rarely affected? How do mechanical forces cause joint degeneration? What biologic and mechanical factors slow or accelerate the rate of joint degeneration? Answering these questions could lead to effective methods of preventing osteoarthritis and slowing its progression.},

	abstract = {Early loosening and implant migration are two problems that lead to failures in cementless (press-fit) femoral knee components of total knee replacements. To begin to address these early failures, this study determined the anterior-posterior mechanical properties from four locations in the human distal femur. Thirty-three cylindrical specimens were removed perpendicular to the press-fit surface after the surgical cuts on 10 human cadaveric femurs (age 71.5+/-14.2 years) had been made. Compression testing was performed that utilized methods to reduce the effects of end-artifacts. The bone mineral apparent density (BMAD), apparent modulus of elasticity, yield and ultimate stress, and yield and ultimate strain were measured for 28 cylindrical specimens. The apparent modulus, yield and ultimate stress, and yield and ultimate strain each significantly differed (p{\textless}0.05) in the superior and inferior locations. Linear and power law relationships between superior and inferior mechanical properties and BMAD were determined. The inferior apparent modulus and stresses were higher than those in the superior locations. These results show that the press-fit fixation characteristics of the femoral knee component differ on the anterior shield and posterior condyles. This information will be useful in the assignment of mechanical properties in finite element models for further investigations of femoral knee components. The property-density relations also have applications for implant design and preoperative assessment of bone strength using clinically available tools.},

We hypothesized that microdamage accumulation is positively and linearly correlated with a reduction in bone's elastic modulus. We also tested the hypothesis that damage accumulates more rapidly in tensile cortices, but crack growth is greater in compressive cortices. Canine femurs were tested in four-point cyclic bending under load control until they had lost between 5 and 43\% of their stiffness. Ten femurs were used as nonloaded controls. The loaded portion of the bone was stained en bloc with basic fuchsin to detect the presence of microdamage. The number of stained microcracks, their lengths and the area of damaged bone were measured under the microscope. Crack numerical density, surface density, mean crack length, and the percentage of damaged area were calculated. Significant microdamage accumulation was not detected until the bone had lost 15\% of its elastic modulus. The relationship between crack density and stiffness loss was approximately quadratic, but the relationship between damaged area and stiffness loss was linear. There were significantly more microcracks in tensile cortices, but on average cracks were significantly longer in compressive cortices. We conclude that microcrack accumulation impairs the mechanical properties of bone by reducing its elastic modulus. We also conclude that damage accumulates more rapidly in tensile cortices, but crack growth is greater in compressive cortices.},

	abstract = {The understanding of load transfer characteristics is the baseline for biomechanics of the ankle joint. Changes in contact patterns of the articular cartilage from the norm may indicate pathologic conditions. Measurement of the contact in human cadaver ankles provides a direct measurement for this understanding. The force transfer characteristics of the three facets of the ankle joint were investigated. Five fresh-frozen cadaver lower extremities were tested in 12 positions under three axial loads of 490, 686, and 980 N. Fuji film served as the pressure transducer and the prints were analyzed by a computerized video digitizer. The results demonstrated that as the foot was moved into inversion or eversion with the ankle in neutral flexion or dorsiflexion, there was a decrease in total contact area and an increase in the average high pressure. In plantarflexion, the contact area was lower and the average high pressure was higher, indicating a greater force per unit area as compared with dorsiflexion and neutral flexion. In plantarflexion, however, little change was noted with inversion or eversion. In dorsiflexion, the total contact area was higher and the average high pressure slightly lower as compared with neutral flexion. With inversion, the contact area of the medial facet of the ankle increased and with eversion it increased on the lateral facet, especially in dorsiflexion. With an increase in loading, the pressure did not significantly increase but the contact area did increase. The centroid of the contact moved anteriorly to posteriorly on the talus as the joint moved from dorsiflexion to plantar-flexion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Scanning electron microscopy and digital image analysis were used for characterization and sizing. The average equivalent circle diameter ranged from 0.27 microm to 0.69 microm, which corresponded well with published clinical findings. Common to all wear tests was that the lubricant contained albumin or globulin, and that the relative motion was multidirectional. In the hip wear simulation, the particle size distribution was not sensitive to the type of loading, counterface material, protein content of the lubricant, and whether the polyethylene was irradiated. In the knee wear simulation, the debris on average was larger than in the hip wear simulation. The simulators produced wear particles similar to those seen clinically, which indicates that the current test methods are relevant for assessing wear of prosthetic joints.},

	abstract = {Skeletal regeneration is accomplished by a cascade of biologic processes that may include differentiation of pluripotential tissue, endochondral ossification, and bone remodeling. It has been shown that all these processes are influenced strongly by the local tissue mechanical loading history. This article reviews some of the mechanobiologic principles that are thought to guide the differentiation of mesenchymal tissue into bone, cartilage, or fibrous tissue during the initial phase of regeneration. Cyclic motion and the associated shear stresses cause cell proliferation and the production of a large callus in the early phases of fracture healing. For intermittently imposed loading in the regenerating tissue: (1) direct intramembranous bone formation is permitted in areas of low stress and strain; (2) low to moderate magnitudes of tensile strain and hydrostatic tensile stress may stimulate intramembranous ossification; (3) poor vascularity can promote chondrogenesis in an otherwise osteogenic environment; (4) hydrostatic compressive stress is a stimulus for chondrogenesis; (5) high tensile strain is a stimulus for the net production of fibrous tissue; and (6) tensile strain with a superimposed hydrostatic compressive stress will stimulate the development of fibrocartilage. Finite element models are used to show that the patterns of tissue differentiation observed in fracture healing and distraction osteogenesis can be predicted from these fundamental mechanobiologic concepts. In areas of cartilage formation, subsequent endochondral ossification normally will proceed, but it can be inhibited by intermittent hydrostatic compressive stress and accelerated by octahedral shear stress (or strain). Later, bone remodeling at these sites can be expected to follow the same mechanobiologic adaptation rules as normal bone.},

	abstract = {The method of considering a single loading condition in the study of stress/morphology relationships in trabecular bone is expanded to include the multiple loading conditions experienced by bone in vivo. The bone daily loading histories are characterized in terms of stress magnitudes or cyclic strain energy density and the number of loading cycles. Relationships between local bone apparent density and loading history are developed which assume that bone mass is adjusted in response to strength or energy considerations. Three different bone maintenance criteria are described which are formulated based upon: (1) continuum model effective stress, (2) continuum model fatigue damage accumulation density, and (3) bone tissue strain energy density. These approaches can be applied to predict variations in apparent density within bone and among bones. We show that all three criteria have similar mathematical forms and may be related to the density (or concentration) of bone strain energy which is transferred (dissipated) in the mineralized tissue. The loading history and energy transfer concepts developed here can be applied to many different situations of growth, functional adaptation, injury, and aging of connective tissues.},

	abstract = {Excised specimens of cancellous bone from human femora were subjected to compressive or tensile testing, and the resulting force-displacement curves were recorded. The relationships between bone strength and apparent density were similar for specimens tested in these two loading modes. The modulus of elasticity was also comparable for the tensile and compressive specimens. Specimens loaded in compression absorbed considerable energy after the initial fracture because of progressive impaction of the trabeculae. In the specimens loaded in tension, the fractured bone fragments separated and therefore absorbed little additional energy after the initial failure. The energy absorption capacity was thus significantly lower for the tensile specimens. The results of this study show that the primary difference in mechanical properties of cancellous bone tested in tension and compression is the energy absorption capacity. This finding suggests that tensile and avulsion fractures of cancellous bone observed clinically are associated with minimal energy absorption and therefore may be precipitated by relatively minor trauma.},

The displacement and the stress distributions both in bone and implants and the internal bone remodelling process after fracture and fixation are obtained and analysed by computational simulation. The main conclusions of this work are that distal femoral fractures can be treated correctly with the Condyle Plate, the LISS plate and the DFN. The stresses both in LISS and DFN implant are high especially around the screws. When respect to remodelling, the LISS produces an important resorption in the fractured region, while the other two implants do not strongly modify bone tissue microstructure.},

In this study, differences in bone formation around three kinds of ceramics and the importance of the implant location in the tibia were investigated. In the first experiment, we placed three kinds of ceramics–alumina, zirconia and hydroxyapatite (HA)–into the medullary cavity of rabbit tibiae and examined histologically the time-dependent formation of bone around the materials for up to 24 weeks postoperatively. We found that bone formation depends on whether or not the materials are in direct contact with the endosteum. In the second experiment, the same three ceramic materials were implanted transcortically into rabbit tibiae. The bone formed around the implants was most abundant in regions adjacent to the periosteum, followed by the endosteum and the marrow cavity in the approximate ratios of 70\%, 40\%, and 10\%, respectively. In these two experiments, the difference between bioactive and bioinert ceramics could be seen in the interface between the implanted material and the bone. It can be concluded that bone formation around these materials is related to the osteoconductivity of the materials and to the osteogenic capacity of the tissues.},

The two methods were considered with respect to standard extrapolation and interpolation calibration cages. Matlab simulations showed that reconstruction accuracy was greatly improved ({\textgreater}60\%) by combining DLT with an even distribution of enclosing calibration markers. Second, a benchtop study using phantoms translated at 0.0254-mm intervals showed initial-calibration, followed by removal of the interpolation cage for subsequent exposures, was potentially twice as accurate as self-calibration with an extrapolation cage.

The proximal tibia, distal femur, proximal femur, distal radius, and proximal humerus from fresh cadaver specimens between the ages of 55 and 70 years were excised and prepared for experimentation. The bones were embedded and scanned at 1 or 1.5 mm intervals on a Technicare HPS 1440 and GE 9800 CT scanner. After scanning, the bones were sectioned, producing 8-mm cubes of trabecular bone which were mechanically tested in uniaxial compression at a strain rate of 1\%. The testing sequence consisted of preyield tests in two of the three orthogonal directions and failure in the third. After testing, the cubes were evaluated for apparent density and ash weight. The results of the study show that the strength and stiffness of trabecular bone varies significantly within metaphyseal regions and from metaphysis to metaphysis. The power and significance of relationships between density and modulus varied as a function of metaphyseal location. Both linear and nonlinear models were significant, suggesting that trabecular deformation occurs in response to both axial and bending loads. Finally, the need for architectural measures of trabecular bone to predict mechanical properties is emphasized.},

	abstract = {As more therapies are introduced to treat osteoporosis, precise in vivo methods are needed to monitor response to therapy and to estimate the gains in bone strength that result from treatment. A method for evaluating the strength of the proximal femur was developed and its short term reproducibility, or precision, was determined in vivo. Ten volunteer subjects aged 51-62 years (mean 55.6 years), eight women and two men, were examined using a quantitative computed tomography (QCT) protocol. They were positioned, scanned, repositioned and re-scanned. The QCT images were registered in three-dimensional space, and finite element (FE) models were generated and processed to simulate a stance phase load configuration. Stiffness was computed from each FE model, and strength was computed using a regression equation between FE stiffness and fracture load for a small set (n = 6) of experimental specimens. The coefficients of variation (COV) and repeatability (COR= 2.23* 42*COV) were determined. The COV for the FE fracture load computed was 1.85\%, and the detectable limit (coefficient of repeatability) for serial measurements was 5.85\%. That is, if a change of 5.85\% or more in computed FE fracture load is observed, it will be too large to be consistent with measurement variation, but instead can be interpreted as a real change in the strength of the bone. The detectable limit of this method makes it suitable for serial research studies on changes in femoral bone strength in vivo.},

Traditional contact area reports are limited by the invasive measuring techniques used and by the complicated loading conditions applied. In the present study, passive flexion tests were performed on three anatomical preparations from lower leg amputation. Roentgen Stereophotogrammetric Analysis was used to accurately reconstruct the position of the tibia and the talus at a number of unconstrained flexion positions. A large number of points was collected on the surface of the tibial mortise and on the trochlea tali by a 3-D digitiser. Articular surfaces were modelled by thin plate splines approximating these points. Relative positions of these surfaces in all the flexion positions were obtained from corresponding bone position data. A distance threshold was chosen to define contact areas. A consistent pattern of contact was found on the articulating surfaces. The area moved anteriorly on both articular surfaces with dorsiflexion. The average position of the contact area centroid along the tibial mortise at maximum plantarflexion and at maximum dorsiflexion was respectively 58\% posterior and 40\% anterior of the entire antero-posterior length. For increasing dorsiflexion, the contact area moved from medial to lateral in all the specimens.},

This non-zero strain is hypothesised to be mostly, if not entirely, describable as creep. This work examines the rate of accumulation of this strain and quantifies its stress dependency. A published relationship determined from creep tests of cortical bone (Journal of Biomechanics 21 (1988) 623) is combined with knowledge of the stress history during fatigue testing to derive an expression for the amount of creep strain in fatigue tests. Fatigue tests on 31 bone samples from four individuals showed strong correlations between creep strain rate and both stress and "normalised stress" (/E) during tensile fatigue testing (0â€“T). Combined results were good (r2=0.78) and differences between the various individuals, in particular, vanished when effects were examined against normalised stress values. Constants of the regression showed equivalence to constants derived in creep tests. The universality of the results, with respect to four different individuals of both sexes, shows great promise for use in computational models of fatigue in bone structures.},

We do not know much about the beginning of tissue construction (morphogenesis) and we do not know the methods of tissue construction. When the tissue structure is altered to accommodate a new loading, we do not know how the decision is made for the structural reconstruction. We do know that tissues grow or reconstruct themselves without ceasing to continue with their structural function, but we do not understand the processes that permit them to accomplish this. Tissues change their structures to altered mechanical environments, but we are not sure how. Tissues heal themselves and we understand little of the structural mechanics of the process.

	abstract = {This study investigated the numerical convergence characteristics of specimen-specific "voxel-based" finite element models of 14 excised human cadaveric lumbar vertebral bodies (age: 37-87; M = 6, F = 8) that were generated automatically from clinical-type CT scans. With eventual clinical applications in mind, the ability of the model stiffness to predict the experimentally measured compressive fracture strength of the vertebral bodies was also assessed. The stiffness of "low"-resolution models (3 x 3 x 3 mm element size) was on average only 4\% greater (p = 0.03) than for "high"-resolution models (1 x 1 x 1.5 mm) despite interspecimen variations that varied over four-fold. Damage predictions using low- vs high-resolution models were significantly different (p = 0.01) at loads corresponding to an overall strain of 0.5\%. Both the high (r2 = 0.94) and low (r2 = 0.92) resolution model stiffness values were highly correlated with the experimentally measured ultimate strength values. Because vertebral stiffness variations in the population are much greater than those that arise from differences in voxel size, these results indicate that imaging resolution is not critical in cross-sectional studies of this parameter. However, longitudinal studies that seek to track more subtle changes in stiffness over time should account for the small but highly significant effects of voxel size. These results also demonstrate that an automated voxel-based finite element modeling technique may provide an excellent noninvasive assessment of vertebral strength.},

However, when a cementless stem is tested, the resultant stresses under load are the sum of the implantation stresses and of those induced by load application. Separating these two components is a critical issue that so far has not been thoroughly solved using photoelasticity.Implantation strains and strain under load were measured separately by a suitable procedure: the photoelastic coating was applied to the femur after stem press-fitting. Thus, when an external load is applied (e.g. to simulate a physiological activity), the fringe patterns indicate the effect of the external load alone. Implantation strains are measured independently, after load removal; the stem is extracted and stresses are released, causing a new fringe pattern. The method was used to investigate the stress pattern caused by press-fitting of two cementless hip stems and that caused by a load applied to the implanted femora.Different isochromatic and isoclinic patterns were observed for the strain distribution caused by load application and by press-fitting for two stem designs. Differences in press-fit pattern and load transfer were successfully detected between the two designs.},

Bone cubes were obtained from different proximal regions of resurfaced cadaveric tibiae. Both monotonic and cyclic fatigue loadings of up to 4000 cycles at 1 Hz were considered. Comparison of measured results indicated that the friction coefficient was not affected by the magnitude of normal stress and the bone excision site (medial, lateral, anterior, posterior, and central). The CM2 surface showed significantly greater resistance with friction coefficients of more than 0.9 for the bone and 0.8 for the polyurethane. The INX surface yielded the second largest resistance followed by CM1 and CTR surfaces. NO significant difference was found between these latter two surfaces. Fatigue tests of up to 4000 loading-unloading cycles showed about 10\% reduction in friction coefficient for CTR and INX surfaces, while negligible reduction was found for CM1 and CM2 surfaces.},

	abstract = {Measured interface nonlinear friction properties are used to develop models to study the short-term fixation response of smooth- and porous-surfaced posts, bone screws, and plates fixed with and without posts/screws. Experimental studies are carried out to validate the model predictions and identify the relative role of posts and screws in fixation of a plate on a polyurethane block under symmetric/eccentric axial compression loads. The idealized Coulomb's friction is also used for the sake of comparison. The incorporation of measured nonlinear, rather than the idealized Coulomb, friction is essential to compute realistic results. For plate fixation, the experimental and finite element results show that the screw fixation yields the stiffest response followed by the smooth- and then porous-coated post fixation. For example, under 1000 N eccentric axial compression, the edge of the plate opposite the loaded edge is measured to lift by 1147 +/- 72, 244 +/- 38, or 112 +/- 28 microns, respectively, for the cases with no fixation, with smooth-surfaced posts, or with screws. The corresponding models predict, respectively, values of 1538, 347, or 259 microns and also 556 microns for the plate fixed with porous coated posts. The satisfactory agreement between numerical and experimental results confirms the importance of proper interface modelling for the analysis of posts, screws, and complex fixation systems. This becomes further evident when considering cementless implants in which the bone-implant interface exhibits relatively large displacements as the maximum resistance force is reached. The developed models can be used to investigate the post-operative short-term stability of various cementless implant designs.},

Excessive relative interface motions are known to inhibit bone ingrowth and, hence, biologic fixation. In the present study, the stability of two cementless tibial implants under static and cyclic loading was studied. An apparatus was developed to perform compression tests on tibial components fixed by screws or posts onto resurfaced tibiae. Motion transducers were placed to record liftoff and subsidence displacements. A load of 1000 N was eccentrically applied on the medial plateau via the femoral component. The response was measured under static and repetitive loading up to 4000 cycles at 1 Hz. Experimental results showed that the screw fixation yielded the stiffer response and, hence, provided greater initial stability. The tibial component fixed with posts demonstrated larger lift off displacements. Comparison of measured results of static tests before and after fatigue indicated that the load-displacement behavior was not significantly affected by the cyclic fatigue loading under 1000 N up to 4000 cycles at 1 Hz. Nevertheless, much larger permanent displacements were recorded for the post fixation systems. In contrast to screw fixation, posts fixation systems demonstrated marked deterioration under larger compression loads of approximately 2000 N.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The expansion in joint arthroplasty surgery in the 1970s has resulted in a large group of patients who require revision arthroplasty for aseptic loosening. Impaction bone grafting to deal with bone stock loss has become an increasingly popular procedure in revision hip surgery. The results of this revision surgery are variable and very much dependent on the grafting techniques adopted at the time of surgery. In vitro testing of impaction bone grafting methods can constitute an important tool to improve long-term clinical results. The increasing clinical demand for human allograft limits its availability for use in in vitro laboratory studies therefore suitable experimental alternatives are required. METHODS: Human, porcine and ovine cancellous bone grafts were morsellised and prepared for in vitro laboratory testing following a standard operative technique. Each graft type was compressed using a die plunger test. After compression to a predetermined level the graft was left to relax for 120s. A comparison of the compression moduli and of the relaxation characteristics for each graft preparation was performed. In addition, the effects of washing the graft and of cartilage removal from the graft mixture were investigated. RESULTS: This study has demonstrated that there is no statistical difference in the compression modulus or relaxation percentage between human and ovine graft preparations. The effect of removing cartilage and washing the graft mixtures were inconsistent with regard to alterations in the viscoelastic properties of the grafts. INTERPRETATION: On the basis of the experiments performed we recommend the use of ovine bone graft as a suitable substitute for human allograft for in vitro testing of impaction bone grafting methods. The properties of ovine graft were similar for both compression moduli and relaxation properties to human allograft.},

	volume = {74},
	abstract = {A linearly elastic, axisymmetrical finite-element model was developed in an attempt to explain observed long-term patterns of growth of bone into tibial components. This model, which represents a portion of the tibial tray, one peg, and the surrounding cancellous bone, was used to examine two conditions of fixation in the immediate postoperative period. The first was characterized by the use of an interference fit for initial fixation of the component and the second, by the use of an interference fit with the hole in the bone deeper than the length of the peg. Two conditions of long-term fixation were also examined. In one, the bone was assumed to have grown into all of the porous coating. In the other, the bone was assumed to have grown only into the peg, and a layer of fibrous tissue was assumed to have developed between the tray and the bone. An interference fit between the peg and the cancellous bone produced considerable residual radial stresses in the bone. These stresses provide conditions that are favorable for ingrowth of bone into the pegs because the bone at the interface is stressed, and these stresses inhibit relative motion at the bone-peg interface. However, the interference fit of the peg relieved the stresses in the cancellous bone under the tray of the implant. Lack of stress at this interface is consistent with relative motion and subsequent formation of a layer of fibrous tissue. Deepening of the hole for the peg in the cancellous bone did not diminish the effects of the interference fit. Stresses in the bone under the metal tray were relieved when a layer of fibrous tissue under the tibial tray was represented in the model.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy and precision of a software-aided system to measure migration of femoral components after total hip replacement (THR) on digitised radiographs. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Subsidence and varus-valgus tilt of THR stems within the femur were measured on digitised anteroposterior pelvic radiographs. The measuring software (UMA, GEMED, Germany) relies on bony landmarks and comparability parameters of two consecutive radiographs. Its accuracy and precision were calculated by comparing it with the gold standard in migration measurements, radiostereometric analysis (RSA). Radiographs and corresponding RSA measurements were performed in 60 patients (38-69 years) following cementless THR surgery. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The UMA software measured the subsidence of the stems with an accuracy of +/-2.5 mm and varus-valgus tilt with an accuracy of +/-1.8 degrees (95\% confidence interval). A good interobserver and intraobserver reliability was calculated with Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.86 to 0.97. Measuring the subsidence of THR stems within the femur is an important parameter in the diagnosis of implant loosening. Software systems such as UMA improve the accuracy of migration measurements and are easy to use on routinely performed radiographs of operated hip joints.},

	abstract = {A thorough understanding of the microstructure of cancellous bone is crucial for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of age-related skeletal diseases. Until now, little has been known about age-related variations in the microstructure of peripheral cancellous bone. This study quantified age-related changes in the three-dimensional (3D) microstructure of human tibial cancellous bone. One hundred and sixty cylindrical cancellous bone specimens were produced from 40 normal proximal tibiae from 40 donors, aged 16-85 years. These specimens were micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scanned, and microstructural properties were determined. The specimens were then tested in compression to obtain Young's modulus. The degree of anisotropy, mean marrow space volume, and bone surface-to-volume ratio increased significantly with age. Bone volume fraction, mean trabecular volume, and bone surface density decreased significantly with age. Connectivity did not have a general relationship with age. Bone volume fraction together with anisotropy best predicted Young's modulus. Age-related changes in the microstructural properties had the same trends for both medial and lateral condyles of the tibia. The observed increase of anisotropy and constant connectivity suggest a bone remodeling mechanism that may reorient trabecular volume orientation in aging tibial cancellous bone. The aging trabeculae align more strongly to the primary direction–parallel to the tibial longitudinal loading axis.},

This study explores regional variations in health care and inequalities in the provision of these expensive interventions, which are high on the UK Government's health agenda. STUDY DESIGN: The Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) for England were analysed. The HES database holds information on patients who are admitted to National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England. METHODS: Age-standardized procedure rates were calculated using 5-year age groups with the English mid-year population of 2000 as the reference. Univariate associations between age-standardized operation rates and regional characteristics were assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Age and sex-standardized surgery rates vary by 25-30\%. For both hip and knee replacement, rates are highest in the South West and Midlands and lowest in the North West, South East and London regions. In the case of knee replacement, there are also marked differences in the sex ratios between regions. The variable that explained most variation in hip replacement rates was the proportion of older people in the region. In the case of knee replacement, the number of NHS centres offering surgery in the region was the main explanatory variable, with regions with fewer centres having the highest provision rates. CONCLUSION: These data can help to inform planning of services. They suggest that there may be inequities as well as inequalities in the provision of primary joint replacement surgery in England.},

This study compared wear reduction by two different cross-linking methods as measured in a hip wear simulator.

Liners of the same design, made from nominally cross-linked (gamma sterilized) polyethylene were also tested. Gravimetric wear analysis was performed every 500,000 cycles for 5,000,000 cycles. After correcting for weight gain due to water absorption, the nominally cross-linked liners demonstrated mean wear rates of 15.7 (+/-1.7) and 12.5 (+/-1.0) mg/million cycles. Both highly cross-linked polyethylene liners demonstrated significantly less wear than their respective controls (with mean wear rates of 1.5 (+/-1.2) and -1.4 (+/-1.5) mg/million cycles). The 9.5 EB liners gained weight presumably due to increased fluid absorption, in addition to that measured in loaded-soaked control implants. Any wear occurring was therefore assumed to have been more than offset by weight gain. Highly cross-linked polyethylene was significantly more wear resistant than non- or nominally cross-linked polyethylene. The differences in wear rates between the two highly cross-linked polyethylene designs (9.5 EB or 10 Gamma) are probably too small to be clinically significant.},

	abstract = {As a step towards developing a finite element model of the knee that can be used to study how the variables associated with a meniscal replacement affect tibio-femoral contact, the goals of this study were 1) to develop a geometrically accurate three-dimensional solid model of the knee joint with special attention given to the menisci and articular cartilage, 2) to determine to what extent bony deformations affect contact behavior, and 3) to determine whether constraining rotations other than flexion/extension affects the contact behavior of the joint during compressive loading. The model included both the cortical and trabecular bone of the femur and tibia, articular cartilage of the femoral condyles and tibial plateau, both the medial and lateral menisci with their horn attachments, the transverse ligament, the anterior cruciate ligament, and the medial collateral ligament. The solid models for the menisci and articular cartilage were created from surface scans provided by a noncontacting, laser-based, three-dimensional coordinate digitizing system with an root mean squared error (RMSE) of less than 8 microns. Solid models of both the tibia and femur were created from CT images, except for the most proximal surface of the tibia and most distal surface of the femur which were created with the three-dimensional coordinate digitizing system. The constitutive relation of the menisci treated the tissue as transversely isotropic and linearly elastic. Under the application of an 800 N compressive load at 0 degrees of flexion, six contact variables in each compartment (ie., medial and lateral) were computed including maximum pressure, mean pressure, contact area, total contact force, and coordinates of the center of pressure. Convergence of the finite element solution was studied using three mesh sizes ranging from an average element size of 5 mm by 5 mm to 1 mm by 1 mm. The solution was considered converged for an average element size of 2 mm by 2 mm. Using this mesh size, finite element solutions for rigid versus deformable bones indicated that none of the contact variables changed by more than 2\% when the femur and tibia were treated as rigid. However, differences in contact variables as large as 19\% occurred when rotations other than flexion/extension were constrained. The largest difference was in the maximum pressure. Among the principal conclusions of the study are that accurate finite element solutions of tibio-femoral contact behavior can be obtained by treating the bones as rigid. However, unrealistic constraints on rotations other than flexion/extension can result in relatively large errors in contact variables.},

In addition to membrane shear stress, loading-induced fluid flow will enhance chemotransport due to convection or mass transport thereby affecting the biochemical environment surrounding the cell. This study investigated the role of oscillating fluid flow induced shear stress and chemotransport in cellular mechanotransduction mechanisms in bone. Intracellular calcium mobilization and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production were studied with varying levels of shear stress and chemotransport. In this study MC3T3-E1 cells responded to oscillating fluid flow with both an increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and an increase in PGE2 production. These fluid flow induced responses were modulated by chemotransport. The percentage of cells responding with an [Ca2+]i oscillation increased with increasing flow rate, as did the production of PGE2. In addition, depriving the cells of nutrients during fluid flow resulted in an inhibition of both [Ca2+]i mobilization and PGE2 production. These data suggest that depriving the cells of a yet to be determined biochemical factor in media affects the responsiveness of bone cells even at a constant peak shear stress. Chemotransport alone will not elicit a response, but it appears that sufficient nutrient supply or waste removal is needed for the response to oscillating fluid flow induced shear stress.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine the dependence of the elastic properties of cortical bone as a transversely isotropic material on its porosity. The longitudinal Young's modulus, transverse Young's modulus, longitudinal shear modulus, transverse shear modulus, and longitudinal Poisson's ratio of cortical bone were determined from eighteen groups of longitudinal and transverse specimens using tensile and torsional tests on a servo-hydraulic material testing system. These cylindrical waisted specimens of cortical bone were harvested from the middle diaphysis of three pairs of human femora. The porosity of these specimens was assessed by means of histology. Our study demonstrated that the longitudinal Young's and shear moduli of human femoral cortical bone were significantly (p{\textless}0.01) negatively correlated with the porosity of cortical bone. Conversely, the elastic properties in the transverse direction did not have statistically significant correlations with the porosity of cortical bone. As a result, the transverse elastic properties of cortical bone were less sensitive to changes in porosity than those in the longitudinal direction. Additionally, the anisotropic ratios of cortical bone elasticity were found to be significantly (p{\textless}0.01) negatively correlated with its porosity, indicating that cortical bone tended to become more isotropic when its porosity increased. These results may help a number of researchers develop more accurate micromechanics models of cortical bone.},

	abstract = {The viscoelastic properties of cancellous bone can be measured nondestructively in compression testing using a dynamic mechanical analyzer. In this study, we examined the effects of end boundary conditions and specimen geometry on the viscoelastic properties of cancellous bone measured by dynamic mechanical analysis. During dynamic compression testing, the cancellous bone specimens may be mechanically fixed (e.g., glued) to the loading platens or they may be free to expand across the platen surface. When specimens of cancellous bone were tested between platens with gluing, the dependence of loss tangent on frequency was not consistent with previously observed strain-rate-dependent mechanical behavior of cancellous bone. When long specimens of cancellous bone (length = 10 mm, diameter = 8 mm) were tested without gluing, the relationship between loss tangent and frequency depended on the level of load applied. For short specimens (length = 5 mm, diameter = 8 mm) tested without gluing, however, the frequency dependence of loss tangent agreed with existing data reported for the strain-rate-dependent behavior of cancellous bone and also with the frequency dependence of cortical bone viscoelasticity. Therefore, we recommend that short cancellous bone cylinders with a length of 5 mm and a diameter of 8 mm should be used without gluing in the dynamic mechanical analysis of cancellous bone. This is consistent with the American Society for Testing and Materials testing recommendations for plastics, but different from current practice for unimodal mechanical testing of cancellous bone.},

	abstract = {Histomorphologic analyses of artificial joint components implanted into bone need special technology for processing and for documentation; published histological work systematically done therefore is rare. The histopathology, three-dimensionally analyzed in a complete sequence of sections is, however, the only precise answer in terms of biocompatibility and bone response. A complete analysis allows a type-related predictable prognosis of an implantation that is at least comparable to a finite element analysis with respect to load transfer to host bone. The histopathologic collection of the ZOW Munich is comprised of more than 5000 nondemineralized bone and joint specimens and more than 500 artificial joint components implanted in the human skeleton for up to 25 years. Fifty-nine implant-bone specimens without signs of loosening already have been processed and analyzed systematically. According to the strain-adapted bone remodelling, different types of anchorage clearly were differentiated and their morphologic substrate could be worked out. Based on that, the cemented standard anchorage could be distinguished histologically from the cemented press-fit procedure, and the noncemented press-fit from the porous ingrowths pattern. In terms of the topography of the bony integration, the proximal and distal press-fit and ingrowth pattern were analyzed; beside that, the cemented and noncemented epiphyseal resurfacings could be defined histologically. In all histologic specimens the remodelling appeared as a result of stress-related strain, reflecting stiffness of the implant and the resistance of bone to deformation. It clearly was worked out that all success of cemented components is based on preserved cancellous bone honeycombs stiffened by bone cement, representing an adaptation of bone in terms of stiffness to the stiff implants.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To study the comprehensive biomechanical properties of the cancellous bone of distal femur through a series of mechanical tests, and provide relevant subjects with the basic technical data. BACKGROUNDS: The study on bone mechanics is a commonly used approach to evaluate the biomechanical competency of bone. The biomechanical properties of bone have come to be the precondition of the further research of these relevant clinical subjects. METHODS: In this paper, comprehensive items of mechanical properties of the cancellous bones of distal femur were conducted, and many valuable test results were obtained through a series of mechanical tests, which comprised tensile test, compression test, torsion test, shear test, bending test and impact test. The specimens were extracted from the normal corpses of Chinese donors died from acute head injury. As another key problem in this kind of experiment, the sampling and fixing method of cancellous bones specimens was developed and optimized in this research. RESULTS: A series of the experimental data of mechanical properties of cancellous bones were obtained in the tests, these experimental data include tensile strength, compression strength, yield tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, torsion strength, shear strength, torsion modulus, bending strength, yield shear limit and impact toughness, which can reflect the complex mechanical competency of bone, being of great value and practice in clinic and further research on cancellous bones. The mechanical properties of the cancellous bones of distal femur were analyzed and discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The biomechanical properties of the cancellous bones have a close relationship with individual difference. Comprehensive items of the mechanical properties of the bone can evaluate the mechanical performance of the bone better, and can provide more valuable data to relevant research.},

	abstract = {A number of Monte Carlo codes are available, which can be used to calculate dose distributions in patients with high accuracy. Patient geometry can readily be derived with adequate spatial resolution from CT scans. To perform the Monte Carlo calculation with the same spatial resolution, it is necessary to enter the atomic composition and density of the tissue in each voxel of the CT image. This means entering 65 536 discrete values for a CT slice with a 256*256 matrix size. The need for automated methods of setting up the material data files is obvious. Because there is no direct unique relationship between CT numbers and material composition, the aim of our work was to devise a method whereby the atomic composition and density in each voxel could be assigned automatically by indirect derivation from the CT numbers. The set of all tissues types in the human body was divided into subsets that are dosimetrically equivalent, based on Monte Carlo calculated depth dose curves in homogeneous phantoms of each tissue. CT number ranges corresponding to each tissue subset were determined from the calibration curve linking electron density with CT number for the specific CT scanner. Further subdivision was found to be necessary for the lung and bone type tissues. This was done by keeping the atomic composition constant and varying the physical density. It was found that 57 distinct tissue subsets were needed to represent the 16 main tissue types in the body at a 1\% dose level. Corresponding CT number intervals of 30 HU were needed in the lung and soft tissue region, whereas in the bone region the intervals could be increased to 100 HU. A computer algorithm was set up to convert automatically from CT number to corresponding equivalent material number for the Monte Carlo preprocessor code},

Radiographic outcome was correlated with the shape and material of the femoral component. Specifically, throughout the follow-up, stems made of titanium alloy were at greater risk of developing boneâ€“cement radiolucent lines than those made of stainless steel, the difference ranging from approximately 10â€“50 percent at 2â€“10 years of follow-up. Similarly, titanium alloy stems were at greater risk of developing endosteal scalloping, indicating osteolytic lesions. Among the stainless steel Charnley cobra and straight-narrow Charnley stems, none developed cement fracture, only one became radiographically loose and one developed endosteal scalloping. The differences in the risk of developing radiolucent lines, cement fracture and progressive loosening among these stems were correlated with the relative rigidity of the femoral stems, and were generally consistent with the predictions made heretofore using finite element models, although differences in stem surface finish and femoral ball size and material could have also influenced the results.},

	abstract = {The wear, wear debris and functional biological activity of non-crosslinked and moderately crosslinked ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) acetabular cups have been com pared when articulating against smooth and intentionally scratched femoral heads. Volumetric wear rates were determined in a hip joint simulator and the debris was isolated from the lubricant and characterized by the percentage number and volumetric concentration as a function of particle size. The volumetric concentration was integrated with the biological activity function determined from in vitro cell culture studies to predict an index of specific biological activity (SBA). The product of specific biological activity and volumetric wear rate was used to determine the index of functional biological activity (FBA). On smooth femoral heads the crosslinked UHMWPE had a 30 per cent lower wear rate, but it had a greater percentage volume of smaller, more biologically active particles, which resulted in a similar index of FBA compared with the non-crosslinked material. On the scratched femoral heads the volumetric wear rate was three times higher for the moderately crosslinked UHMWPE and two times higher for the non-crosslinked UHMWPE compared with the smooth femoral heads. This resulted in a higher wear rate for the moderately crosslinked material on the scratched femoral heads. All the differences in wear rate were statistically significant. There were only small differences in particle volume concentration distributions, and this resulted in similar indices of FBA which were approximately twice the values of those found on the smooth femoral heads. Both materials showed lower wear and FBA than for previously studied aged and oxidized UHMWPE gamma irradiated in air. However, this study did not reveal any advantage in terms of predicted FBA for moderately crosslinked UHMWPE compared with non-crosslinked UHMWPE.},

	abstract = {Certain roentgenographic signs have value in predicting the fixation of a cementless femoral component to bone by osseointegration. Other signs have value in predicting the gross stability of a cementless femoral component. The authors have determined the specificity and sensitivity of the signs for osseointegration in cases in which the histologic fixation has been confirmed after implant removal. The authors have also determined the specificity and sensitivity of the signs for gross implant stability in cases in which the stability has been confirmed at reoperation. Statistical methods were used to determine a numeric value for each of these roentgenographic signs, and these values were combined into a score. The score was divided into fixation by osseointegration and mechanical implant stability. The two scores were then combined into an overall score. When signs of osseointegration were present, the implant was always stable, and the overall scores were the highest. When signs of osseointegration were absent, the mechanical stability varied, and the scores were lower. A neutral or slightly negative score correlated with failed osseointegration but secondary successful implant stabilization. A very low negative score correlated with gross implant instability. To confirm the validity of the scoring system, the two-year postoperative score was determined for 1005 cases in which the clinical outcome was known. A strong correlation between the presence of symptoms and a low score confirmed the value of the scoring system for diagnosing implant loosening as the cause of symptoms. As a second test, the two-year and five-year postoperative results were compared in the same patients. A high two-year score correlated with durable implant stability through five years. A low two-year score correlated with a higher incidence of late symptomatic loosening.},

	abstract = {We reviewed the results an average of fifty months (range, twenty-four to 120 months) after the use of thirty-five allografts in thirty patients during primary or revision total knee replacement. Twenty-nine femoral-head allografts, five distal femoral allografts, and one proximal tibial allograft were used in conjunction with a long-stemmed implant to reconstruct large osseous defects. The patients were evaluated clinically, radiographically, and subjectively (with use of a questionnaire). Twenty-six (87 per cent) of the thirty patients had a good or excellent clinical result, and no revisions were necessary. As none of the patients had collapse of the graft, subsidence of the implant, or revision, we believe that the outcome of treatment with a femoral-head allograft, particularly in association with a component inserted with cement, is excellent. Four non-porous-coated components were placed without cement on structural allografts. Radiographically, three of those components subsided, but none of the three needed revision and two were associated with a good clinical result. Our current practice is to cement components in all arthroplasties involving grafting. Our findings suggest that the use of a stemmed component reduces the stress on the allograft, host bone, and fixation interface. In addition, such a component contributes to the longevity of a total knee replacement associated with a bone graft. Additional studies with long-term follow-up are necessary to confirm this outcome.},

	abstract = {The aim of the present study was to describe bone loss of the separate compartments of trabecular and cortical bone, as well as changes in bone geometry of a large number of spinal cord injured (SCI) individuals. Eighty-nine motor complete spinal cord injured men (24 tetraplegics and 65 paraplegics) with a duration of paralysis of between 2 months and 50 years were included in the study. Distal epiphyses and midshafts of the femur, tibia, and radius were measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography. The same measurements were performed in a reference group of 21 healthy able-bodied men of the same age range. In the femur and tibia, bone mass, total and trabecular bone mineral density (BMDtot and BMDtrab, respectively) of the epiphyses, as well as bone mass and cortical cross-sectional area of the diaphyses, showed an exponential decrease with time after injury in the spinal cord injured subjects. The decreasing bone parameters reached new steady states after 3-8 years, depending on the parameter. Bone mass loss in the epiphyses was approximately 50\% in the femur and 60\% in the tibia, while the shafts lost only approximately 35\% in the femur and 25\% in the tibia. In the epiphyses, bone mass was lost by reducing BMD, while in the shaft bone mass was lost by reducing cortical wall thickness, a process achieved by endosteal resorption advancing at a rate of about 0.25 mm/year within the first 5-7 years after injury. Except for a slight transient decrease in cortical BMD of the femoral and tibial shaft during the first 5 years after the spinal cord lesion, cortical BMD of the spinal cord injured subjects was found to be at reference values. Bone parameters of the radial epiphysis in paraplegic subjects showed no deficits compared to the reference group. Furthermore, a trend for an increased radial shaft diameter suggests periosteal apposition as a consequence of increased loading of the arms.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To evaluate the outcome in a prospective 2-year follow-up study of a non-constrained titanium-polyethylene total endoprosthesis (ReFlexion) in the treatment of hallux rigidus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten patients with painful hallux rigidus were treated with a non-constrained titanium-polyethylene total endoprosthesis (ReFlexion). The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scoring was used preoperatively and at follow-up. RESULTS: At 2-year follow-up, the AOFAS scoring shbwed 5 instances of excellent, 1 of good, 2 of fair, and 2 of poor outcome. Eight patient were subjectively satisfied and 2 dissatisfied. Five of the patients were painless, 4 had mild, occasional pain, and 1 had moderate, daily pain in the first metatarsophalangeal joint. The mean VAS was 7.6 (SD 2.0) preoperatively and 1.1 (SD 1.4) at 2-year follow-up (p {\textless} 0.001). Extension increased by a mean of 25 (13-38) degrees and flexion by a mean of 15 (2-35) degrees (p {\textless} 0.001). Eight patients had no activity limitations, while 1 had mild and 1 moderate limitations. Alignment of the metatarsophalangeal joint was good in 7 cases, but some degree of valgus malalignment was seen in 2 and symptomatic malalignment in 1. Complications included one subluxation of a prosthesis, one recurrence of severe valgus alignment and one superficial wound infection. Radiological loosening of one cementless phalangeal component was seen at follow-up. CONCLUSION: The non-constrained titanium-polyethylene total arthroplasty gave satisfactory 2-year outcome in 60\% of the patients.

	abstract = {To assess the use of quantitative computed tomography as an in vivo predictor of fracture in the osteoporotic hip, we examined the in vitro relationship between single-energy quantitative computed tomography data, calibrated for scanner drift, and the mechanical properties of trabecular bone from the proximal femur. For 49 samples, the apparent density and ultimate strength were measured and their functional relationship to the computed tomography data determined. Apparent density demonstrated a moderate linear correlation to the computed tomography numbers (R2 = 0.60), and the ultimate strength was related through a power law (R2 = 0.83). In addition, for 8 intact femora, average computed tomographic data from the sub-capital region were moderately correlated to the ultimate fracture load applied under controlled in vitro conditions (R2 = 0.64). The average fracture energy for these femora was 43 J, a value more than an order of magnitude less than the energy available in a fall from standing height, suggesting that fall mechanics are a more important determinant of fracture risk than has been previously thought. The relationship between the energy absorbed to failure and the computed tomography data was best described by a power law (R2 = 0.90). Based on these results, it appears that quantitative computed tomography provides a potentially useful approach for the direct estimate of that component of fracture risk that can be attributed to a reduction in bone strength.},

One hundred one of these were femoral stems and 101 were tibial stems. Using a modified Knee Society radiographic scoring system, 100 (93\%) of the 107 implants with cemented stems were considered stable, seven (7\%) were categorized as possibly loose requiring close followup, and none were loose. Of the 95 implants placed with cementless stems, only 67 (71\%) were categorized as stable. Eighteen (19\%) were possibly loose requiring close followup and 10 (10\%) were loose (two tibial and eight femoral implants).

The tests enabled total strain to be decomposed into elastic, linear viscoelastic, creep and permanent plastic components. The results indicate that a stress threshold exists; above which time dependent effects dominate material response and below which the behavior is primarily linear viscoelastic, with time effects playing only a secondary role. A constant stress above the threshold produces a constant steady state creep rate, with the magnitude of the creep rate being an exponential function of the stress magnitude. Additionally, it was found that a major portion of the inelastic strain is always recovered on unloading and that the accumulation of creep strain increases the material compliance on subsequent loadings below the threshold. These two factors suggest that a damage mechanism is responsible for the nonlinear behavior.},

	abstract = {Tibiae from 60 male Wistar rats, aged 13 +/- 1 weeks, were divided into six groups for mechanical and histological testing. Bones were loaded repetitively in torsion at 90 deg.s-1. Group 1 was subjected to 5,000 loading cycles at a twist angle of 3.6 degrees, groups 2-5 to 10,000 cycles at 3.6, 5.4, 7.2, and 9.0 degrees, respectively, and group 6 was tested to failure. Six transverse sections from the middiaphysis were then cut, bulk-stained in basic fuchsin, and hand ground to 30-50 microns to examine the presence of microcracks. Cracks were classified as running parallel to lamellae, crossing lamellae, crossing the full thickness of the cortex, or invading vascular canals. Results for fatigue testing showed that the tibiae exhibited a gradual decrease in torque (P less than 0.05), average stress (P less than 0.01), stiffness (P less than 0.01) and energy absorbed (P less than 0.01) from the initial loading cycle. Analysis of microdamage showed an increase in the variety of cracks from groups 1-5. Analysis of deviance demonstrated a strong dependence of crack probability on the level of loading for all crack types (P less than 0.05) except those crossing lamellae. This study reinforces the evidence that yielding of bone observed during repetitive loading is caused by diffuse structural damage such as microcracking or debonding.},

	abstract = {By 1892, Julius Wolff and others realized that mechanical loads can affect bone architecture in living beings, but the mechanisms responsible for this effect were unknown, and it had no known clinical applications. In 2003 we know how this effect occurs and some of its applications. Our load-bearing bones (LBBs) include tibias, femurs, humeri, vertebrae, radii, mandibles, maxillae, wrists, hips, etc (so LBBs are not limited to weight-bearing ones). The strength of such bones and their trabeculae would represent their most important physiologic feature but in the special sense of relative to the size of the typical peak voluntary loads on them. The biologic "machinery" that determines whole-bone strength forms a tissue-level negative feedback system called the mechanostat. Two thresholds make a bone's strains determine its strength by switching on and off the biologic mechanisms that increase or decrease its strength. Equally, two thermostats can determine a room's temperature by switching on and off the room's heating and cooling systems. General features show that the largest voluntary loads on LBBs determine most of their strength after birth. These loads come from muscle forces so muscle strength strongly influences the strength of our LBBs. This process affects, in part, the healing of fractures, bone grafts, osteotomies, and arthrodeses; the bone's ability to endure load-bearing joint and dental endoprostheses; why healthy bones are stronger than the minimum needed to keep voluntary loads from breaking them suddenly or from fatigue; some general functions and disorders of bone modeling and basic multicellular unit-based bone remodeling; some limitations of in vitro data and of pharmaceutical actions; and the fact that many bone-active humoral and local agents have permissive roles in a bone's adaptations and healing, instead of forcing them to occur.},

We have therefore developed a system for measuring micromovement of the tibial component using three non-contact displacement transducers attached to the tibial cortex during total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Using this system we measured the initial stability in 31 uncemented TKAs. All the tibial components were fixed by a stem and four screws. The initial stability was defined as the amount of displacement when a load of 20 kg was applied. The mean subsidence was 60.7 microm and the mean lift-off was 103.3 microm. We also studied the migration of the tibial component using roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA) for up to two years after operation. Most migration occurred during the first six months, after which all prostheses remained stable. We defined migration as the maximum total point motion (MTPM) at two years after operation. The mean migration was 1.29 mm at two years. Our results show that there was a significant correlation between the initial stability and migration (p {\textless} 0.05) and emphasise the importance of the initial stability of the tibial component.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Failure of unicompartmental knees is either by progressive osteoarthritis or by failure of the prosthesis. Prosthesis failure can be because of either the actual component itself or its fixation method. Specifically, the tibial component may wear, loosen or subside into the tibial metaphyseal bone. We modelled all polyethylene tibial components and investigated the periprosthetic adaptive remodelling of the bone. METHODS: Computed tomography scans were used to reconstruct the tibial geometry and a 3-D finite element mesh was created. The tibia loading was set at 45\% of the gait cycle. The distal end of the tibia set as fixed. Implant orientations were in accordance with the manufacturer specifications. The bone mineral density changes at three regions of interest under the component were measured and plotted. RESULTS: All regions of interest became stable at the 12-month time-point. Predictive bone mineral changes were minimal in both resorption and deposition. Zones 1-3 for the St Georg Sled (Waldermar Link, Hamburg, Germany) presented evidence of stress shielding and a maximum loss of approximately 6\% bone mineral density. The Eius (Stryker Orthopaedics, Mahwah, NJ, USA) showed increased loading and caused an increase in bone mineral density for all regions of interests; the maximum being approximately 10\%. CONCLUSION: These findings are consistent with the clinical experience of unicompartmental knee replacements, where the changes are small and have little effect on the outcome of the prosthesis. From a mechanical perspective, the results are also consistent when a compliant material is used to distribute loads. They do, however, support the biomechanical theory that a change in geometry influences the loading environment and as a consequence the adaptive response of the bone is also influenced.},

The mechanism that leads to osteolysis is poorly understood; pressure generation caused by reversible stem micromotion may play an important role. We aimed to determine whether dynamically inducible micromotion occurs in vivo at the prosthesis-cement interface and to use these data to develop and confirm a finite element representation of this interface. Dynamically inducible micromotion was measured using radiostereometric analysis in 21 hips implanted with an Exeter stem, at 3 months and 12 months postoperatively, by changing loading from double-leg stance to single-leg stance. Dynamically inducible micromotion occurred at 3 and 12 months; similar micromotion was observed at both time points. At 3 months the head of the stem was displaced posteriorly (0.10 +/- 0.16 mm) and inferiorly (0.08 +/- 0.12 mm) on loading. A Coulomb friction nonbonded representation of the stem-cement interface was used to fit the clinically measured dynamically inducible micromotion. The final finite element model predicted gap opening and closing between the implant and the mantle. This may be a mechanism for generating pressure and distributing wear debris, which are believed to important contributors to failure.},

Finite element (FE) models of composite bone can be used to evaluate new and modified designs of joint prostheses and fixation devices. The aim of the current study was to create an FE model of a composite tibia and to validate it against results obtained from a comprehensive set of experiments. For this, 17 strain rosettes were attached to a composite tibia (model 3101, Pacific Research Laboratories, Vashon, Washington, USA). Surface strains and displacements were measured under 13 loading conditions. Two FE models were created on the basis of computed tomography scans. The models differed from each other in the mesh and material properties assigned. The experiments were simulated on them and the results compared with experimental results. The more accurate model was selected on the basis of regression analysis. In general, experimental strain measurements were highly repeatable and compared well with published results. The more accurate model, in which the inner elements representing the foam were assigned isotropic material properties and the elements representing the epoxy layer were assigned transversely isotropic material properties, was able to simulate the mechanical behaviour of the tibia with acceptable accuracy. The regression line for all axial loads combined had a slope of 0.999, an intercept of -6.24 microstrain, and an R2 value of 0.962. The root mean square error as a percentage was 5 per cent.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of revision TKA to determine any trends in either the good outcomes or the failures. We found that the success rate for revision TKA was comparable to that for primary TKA. Eighty-nine percent of the knees rated at least fair, with 73\% of these rating good or excellent, and 4\% poor result. Moreover, the findings suggest that if prostheses are aligned correctly at implantation, there is only slight deterioration in their performance over time. Outcome was not affected by the type of prosthesis used in either the previous surgery or the revision. There is a correlation between the number of revisions and the functional knee rating; the more revisions, the less chance for success. There was also a direct correlation between varus knee alignment and significant increased incidence of failure. No appreciable difference was found between degenerative arthritis patients and rheumatoid patients, except that the rheumatoid patients had a higher incidence of delayed infections.},

Each splint was worn for 3 weeks, and hand function was assessed by means of standardized measures of function and disability. Statistical significance was calculated using the minimal level of detectable change (MDC) at the 95\% confidence level. Only with splints 2 and 3 did a true change in function occur, compared with baseline scores (no splint). In addition, the patient completed all tasks while using splints 2 and 3 but did not complete three tasks while using splint 1. The hand therapists' goal is to fabricate a splint that improves function and that the patient will wear. Only splint 3 met these criteria.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the known-groups and construct validity of measures from the CHAMPS Physical Activity Questionnaire, Physical Activity Survey for the Elderly (PASE), and the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS). METHODS: The three questionnaires were administered to a convenience sample of older adults (N = 87) recruited from community centers and retirement homes. Validation measures included the SF-36 measures of physical functioning, general health, mental health, and pain; body mass index; performance-based tests of lower body functioning and endurance; and Mini-Logger activity monitor data from ankle and waist sensors. Validity was estimated by testing hypotheses about associations between physical activity and validation measures. RESULTS: As hypothesized, differences in activity levels on all measures were found between older adults in retirement homes (less active) and community centers (more active) (P-values {\textless} 0.0001). Correlations of physical activity measures with performance-based measures ranged from 0.44 to 0.68, conforming to hypotheses; hypotheses regarding associations with the SF-36 measures were also confirmed. Body mass index was not correlated with any of the physical activity measures, contrary to hypotheses. Correlations of physical activity measures with Mini-Logger counts ranged from 0.36 to 0.59 (ankle) and 0.42 to 0.61 (waist) as hypothesized. Correlations among the measures from the three instruments ranged from 0.58 to 0.68. CONCLUSIONS: The PASE, YPAS, and CHAMPS each demonstrated acceptable validity, as all measures met nearly all hypotheses. Higher validity coefficients were found for subgroups (men, 65-74 yr, retirement home), suggesting that these instruments may perform better for certain segments of the older adult population.},

Two equations relating the modulus of elasticity to apparent density were used. These models were then verified mechanically by measuring strains of the two specimens under applied load. Equation I correlated best with measured strains in the less-dense regenerate bone of the distracted tibia (R2 = 0.914, p = 0.0028, n = 6); Equation II performed best in the denser control tibia (R2 = 0.820, p = 0.0129, n = 6).

Previous studies have been done on a small number of patients and only included the younger patients. In many cases patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis have been included in the studies and exceptional survival rates have been reported. The current study compared the cumulative revision rate of the components in 33,251 patients older than 60 years and 2606 patients younger than 60 years treated with total knee arthroplasty or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis or similar conditions. Cox regression was used to compare the risk for revision between the two age groups and between gender and the effect of year of operation. The results showed a higher cumulative revision rate for the group of younger patients in all statistical analyses and the risk ratio for revision was significantly lower for the group of older patients. The risk for revision decreased for both groups when considering the year of surgery. This is probably attributable to better implant components and surgical techniques.},

	volume = {3},
	abstract = {A three dimensional nonlinear finite element model was developed to investigate tibial fixation designs and friction models (Coulomb's vs nonlinear) in total knee arthroplasty in the immediate postoperative period with no biological attachment. Bi-directional measurement-based nonlinear friction constitutive equations were used for the bone-porous coated implant interface. Friction properties between the polyethylene and femoral components were measured for this study. Linear elastic isotropic but heterogeneous mechanical properties taken from literature were considered for the bone. The Tensile behaviour of polyethylene was measured and subsequently modeled by an elasto-plastic model. Based on the earlier finite element and experimental pull-out studies, pegs and screws were also realistically modeled. The geometry of every component was obtained through measurement. The PCA tibial baseplate with three different configurations was considered; one with three screws, one with one screw and two short inclined porous-coated pegs, and a third one with no fixation for the sake of comparison. The axial load of 2000N was applied through the femoral component on the medial plateau of articular insert. It was found that Coulomb's friction significantly underestimates the relative micromotion at the bone-implant interface. The lowest micromotion and lift-off were found for the design with screws. Relative micromotion and stress transfer at the bone-implant interface depended significantly on the friction model and on the baseplate anchorage configuration. Cortical and cancellous bones carried, respectively, 10-13\% and 65-86\% of the axial load depending on the fixation configuration used. The remaining portion was transmitted as shear force by screws and pegs. Normal and Mises stresses as well as contact area in the polyethylene insert were nearly independent of the baseplate fixation design. The Maximum Mises stress in the polyethylene exceeded yield and was found 1-2 mm below the contact surface for all designs.},

Energy absorption occurred largely in this postyield regime. Yield strength and energy absorption capacity were found to increase linearly with specimen apparent density. Microstructural analysis of the deformed specimens verfied that the mechanism for energy absorption was primarily fracture and buckling of trabeculae. The results suggest that during fracture, the collapse of trabecular bone (and the consequent absorption of energy) serves to attenuate stresses transmitted through the skeleton and thus protect vital structures such as the brain.},

The etiology of the crack propagation process from the stem-cement interface is not well understood, but cracks are typically associated with thin cement mantles. In this study, a combination of experimental and computational methods was used to investigate the fatigue crack propagation process from the stem-PMMA cement interface using a novel torsional loading model. Constructs with thin (1 mm), medium (3 mm) or thick (7 mm) cement mantles were evaluated. Crack growth was stable for all cases and the rate of crack growth diminished with increasing crack length. Crack growth rate did not depend on mantle thickness (p {\textgreater} 0.05) over the first 1 mm of crack length, but cracks in thin mantles reached the full thickness of the mantle in the fewest number of loading cycles. The fracture mechanics-based finite element models indicated decreased stress intensity factors with increasing crack length and were consistent with the experimental findings. When combined with a fatigue crack growth Paris-law for PMMA cement, the finite element models provided reasonable predictions of the crack growth process.},

During aging and disease, plates are perforated and connecting rods are dissolved. There is a continuous shift from one structural type to the other. So traditional histomorphometric procedures, which are based on a fixed model type, will lead to questionable results. The introduction of three-dimensional (3D) measuring techniques in bone research makes it possible to capture the actual architecture of cancellous bone without assumptions of the structure type. This requires, however, new methods that make direct use of the 3D information. Within the framework of a BIOMED I project of the European Union, we analyzed a total of 260 human bone biopsies taken from five different skeletal sites (femoral head, vertebral bodies L2 and L4, iliac crest, and calcaneus) from 52 donors. The samples were measured three-dimensionally with a microcomputed tomography scanner and subsequently evaluated with both traditional indirect histomorphometric methods and newly developed direct ones. The results show significant differences between the methods and in their relation to the bone volume fraction. Based on the direct 3D analysis of human bone biopsies, it appears that samples with a lower bone mass are primarily characterized by a smaller plate-to-rod ratio, and to a lesser extent by thinner trabecular elements.},

Connectivity was highly correlated with apparent density, and so it is difficult to assign relative weights to these two variables. However, both have a significant, and separate, effect on Young's modulus. The total variance in Young's modulus explained by these three variables was about 85 per cent. This implies that other explanatory variables are either unimportant or highly correlated with the variables listed above. Mineral volume fraction is shown to be an unimportant variable, and arguments are produced why this is to be expected, even though it is highly important in explaining the variation in Young's modulus of compact bone.},

	abstract = {A homogenization sampling procedure is introduced which allows computation of effective trabecular bone stiffness and individual trabecula level stress based on precise models of trabecular bone architecture. Three-dimensional digitized images of 53 trabecular bone specimens with a resolution of 50 microns per voxel were directly converted into three-dimensional finite element meshes by making each voxel an 8-node isoparametric brick element. Owing to the large mesh of 8000 elements, an element-by-element preconditioned conjugate gradient (EBEPCG) program was written to solve the local homogenization finite element equations. Predicted effective stiffness measures correlated well with experimental results (R2 {\textgreater} 0.73). The predicted effective stiffness tended to under estimate the experimental values. Average absolute errors in effective stiffness estimates ranged between 31 and 38\% for the sampling procedure compared to a range 49-150\% for a regression fit to volume fraction squared. Trabecula level stress ranged between -200 and +300 times that predicted by analyzing trabecular bone as a continuum. Both tensile and compressive tissue stresses were engendered by a continuum compressive stress. Trabecula level strain energy density (SED) ranged between 0 and 100 times the continuum SED value for two trabecular specimens. In conclusion, the homogenization sampling procedure consistently predicted the influence of trabecular bone architecture on effective stiffness. It can also provide trabecular tissue stress and strain estimates for arbitrary global loading of whole bones. Tissue stresses and strains showed large variations compared to corresponding continuum level quantities.},

In this study, harvestable amounts of interfacial fibrous tissue were generated using a prosthetic replacement of the canine stifle joint as an animal model. The collected tissues were examined histologically and by uniaxial, unconfined compression tests. The fibrous tissue had a matlike structure. The heavy collagen fibers were distributed at random in sheets and the sheets themselves were layered to form a mat. Such a structure may be able to resist compressive stresses normal to the plane of the mat but is probably not well suited to resist shearing stresses. The fibrous tissue proved to be a very compliant, deformable material and to undergo very large strains with load. The stress-strain curve for the tissue was nonlinear and was characterized by large deformations at low loads. But with increasing loads, the material became stiffer, and at high loads, the stress-strain curve became linear with a short-term tangent modulus of 1.9 MPa at a stress level of 0.5 MPa and a compressive strain level of 50\%. With regard to total joint replacement systems which consist of an outer bone shell followed by a thin layer of fibrous tissue, a mantle of PMMA cement and a central core of metal or UHMW polyethylene, the fibrous tissue is substantially more yielding and deformable than the other elements of the structure and may have a significant effect on the structural behavior of the system.},

Historically, finite element models (FEMs) have been useful for predicting disc mechanics in humans. However, differences in geometry and tissue properties may limit the predictive utility of these models for rodent discs. Clearly, models that are specific for rodent tail discs and accurately simulate the disc's transient mechanical behavior would serve as important tools for clarifying disc mechanics in these animal models. An FEM was developed based on the structure, geometry, and scale of the mouse tail disc. Importantly, two sources of time-dependent mechanical behavior were incorporated: viscoelasticity of the matrix, and fluid permeation. In addition, a novel strain-dependent swelling pressure was implemented through the introduction of a dilatational stress in nuclear elements. The model was then validated against data from quasi-static tension-compression and compressive creep experiments performed previously using mouse tail discs. Finally, sensitivity analyses were performed in which material parameters of each disc subregion were individually varied. During disc compression, matrix consolidation was observed to occur preferentially at the periphery of the nucleus pulposus. Sensitivity analyses revealed that disc mechanics was greatly influenced by changes in nucleus pulposus material properties, but rather insensitive to variations in any of the endplate properties. Moreover, three key features of the model-nuclear swelling pressure, lamellar collagen viscoelasticity, and interstitial fluid permeation-were found to be critical for accurate simulation of disc mechanics. In particular, collagen viscoelasticity dominated the transient behavior of the disc during the initial 2200 s of creep loading, while fluid permeation governed disc deformation thereafter. The FEM developed in this study exhibited excellent agreement with transient creep behavior of intact mouse tail motion segments. Notably, the model was able to produce spatial variations in nucleus pulposus matrix consolidation that are consistent with previous observations in nuclear cell morphology made in mouse discs using confocal microscopy. Results of this study emphasize the need for including nucleus swelling pressure, collagen viscoelasticity, and fluid permeation when simulating transient changes in matrix and fluid stress/strain. Sensitivity analyses suggest that further characterization of nucleus pulposus material properties should be pursued, due to its significance in steady-state and transient disc mechanical response.},

	title = {A survey of finite element analysis in orthopedic biomechanics: the first decade},
	volume = {16},
	abstract = {The finite element method (FEM), an advanced computer technique of structural stress analysis developed in engineering mechanics, was introduced to orthopedic biomechanics in 1972 to evaluate stresses in human bones. Since then, this method has been applied with increasing frequency for stress analyses of bone and bone-prosthesis structures, fracture fixation devices and various kinds of tissues other than bone. The aims of these investigations were to assess relationship between load carrying functions and morphology of the tissues, and to optimize designs and fixation techniques of implants. Although the amounts of significant findings and useful concepts generated by the FEM during the first decade of its application in this field were limited, many publications have served to illustrate its capabilities and limitations. The method is now well established as a tool for basic research and for design analysis in orthopedic biomechanics, and the number of publications in which it is used is increasing rapidly. In the meantime, following developments in engineering mechanics, the capabilities of the method are augmented which, together with an increasing sophistication of computers, guarantees exciting possibilities for the future. However, the biological structures and the clinical problems concerned are complex. Scientific progress in this area requires a sound understanding of engineering mechanics on the one hand, and a profound appreciation of the complex reality on the other. These features were not always apparent in the FEM work reported during the first ten years. In the following survey, the developments of FEM applications in orthopedic biomechanics during the first decade are discussed. Special problem areas are indicated and future trends anticipated.},

However, besides having complicated shapes, musculoskeletal tissues are hierarchical composites with multiple structural levels that adapt to their mechanical environment. Mechanical adaptation influences the success of many orthopaedic treatments, especially total joint replacements. Recent advances in FEA applications have begun to address questions concerning the optimality of bone structure, the processes of bone remodeling, the mechanics of soft hydrated tissues, and the mechanics of tissues down to the microstructural and cell levels. Advances in each of these areas, which have brought FEA from a continuum stress analysis tool to a tool which plays an ever-increasing role in the scientific understanding of tissue structure, adaptation, and the optimal design of orthopaedic implants, are reviewed.},

To reduce stress shielding and periprosthetic bone loss, proximal fixation and load transfer are indicated. However, to prevent interface motion and promote interface-bonding security, fixation preferably should be maximized over the entire stem surface. In this study, the authors questioned whether hydroxyapatite coatings could be applied in patterns that reduce bone resorption, while maintaining safe interface stress levels. For that purpose, strain-adaptive bone-remodeling theory was applied in 3-dimensional finite element models, to simulate the long-term postoperative bone resorption process. During the process, the adaptation of interface stresses was monitored, and its effects on interface failure probability evaluated. This analysis was done for a fully coated stem, a 1/3 proximally coated stem, a smooth uncoated, press-fitted stem, and a stem with 5 proximal patches of circumferential stripes. The uncoated stem reduced bone loss dramatically, but promoted interface motions and distal pedestal formation. In all cases, the gradual bone-remodeling process increased the interface security of the coated stems. Bone loss and interface failure probability were not very different for the fully and 1/3-coated stems. Stripe coating reduced bone resorption considerably, while increasing long-term interface failure probability only slightly. The investigators concluded that the initial stability and the ingrowth potential of such a stem design are likely to be inadequate.},

	abstract = {An analytical parametric model was developed to estimate the natural biological variations in muscle forces and their effect on the hip forces subject only to physiological constraints and not predefined optimization criterion. Force predictions are based on the joint kinematics and kinetics of each subject, a previously published muscle model, and physiological constraints on the muscle force distributions. The model was used to determine the hip contact forces throughout the stance phase of gait of a subject with a total hip replacement (THR). The parametrically modeled peak hip force without antagonistic muscle activity varied from 2.7 to 3.2 Body Weights (mean 2.9 Body Weights), which agreed well with published in vivo measurements from instrumented THRs in other subjects. For every 10\% increase in antagonistic activity, the mean peak hip force increased by 0.2 Body Weights. The parametric model allows one to examine the effect of specific muscle weaknesses or increased antagonistic muscle activity on the hip forces. The model also provides a tool for studying the effect of gait adaptations on hip forces, as predictions are based on each individual's gait data. Differences in peak forces between subjects can then be evaluated relative to the uncertainty in not knowing the precise muscle force distributions. Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {Although recent nanoindentation studies have revealed the existence of substantial variations in tissue modulus within single specimens of trabecular bone, little is known regarding the biomechanical effects of such intraspecimen variations. In this study, high-resolution finite element modeling was used to investigate these effects. With limited literature information on the spatial distribution of intraspecimen variations in tissue modulus, two plausible spatial distributions were evaluated. In addition, three specimens (human femoral neck, human vertebral body, and bovine proximal tibia) were studied to assess the role of trabecular architecture. Results indicated that for all specimen/distribution combinations, the apparent modulus of the whole specimen decreased nonlinearly with increasing coefficient of variation (COV) of tissue modulus within the specimen. Apparent modulus decreased by {\textless}4\% when tissue modulus COV was increased from 0\% to 20\% but decreased by 7-24\%, depending on the assumed spatial distribution, for an increase in tissue modulus COV from 20\% to 50\%. For compressive loading to the elastic limit, increasing tissue modulus COV from 20\% to 50\% caused up to a 28-fold increase in the amount of failed tissue, depending on assumed spatial distribution and trabecular architecture. We conclude that intraspecimen variations in tissue modulus, if large, may have appreciable effects on trabecular apparent modulus and tissue-level failure. Since the observed effects depended on the assumed spatial distribution of the tissue modulus variations, a description of such distributions, particularly as a function of age, disease, and drug treatment, may provide new insight into trabecular bone structure-function relationships.},

	abstract = {Long bone structure occurs in two distinct forms. The bone mass near the joint is primarily found in a distributed, porous trabecular structure, while in the diaphyses a tubular cortical structure is formed. It seems likely that these two observed morphologies come about, at least in part, as a mechanical adaptation to the different mechanical demands in the two regions. Mathematical formulations of this dependency have been proposed, thus facilitating numerical simulations of bone adaptation. Recently two types of discontinuities have been observed in these simulations. The first type (near-field) appears in areas near distributed load application and is characterized by a 'checkerboard' pattern of density wherein adjacent remodeled elements alternate between low and high density. The second type of discontinuity (far-field) appears remote from the load application and is characterized by strut or column-like regions of elements which become fully compact bone while adjacent regions are fully resorbed. In fact, the far-field discontinuity is an accurate representation of bone physiology and morphology since it is consistent with the appearance of cortical bone in the diaphysis. On the other hand, the near-field discontinuity, appears in a region where continuous distributions of intermediate apparent densities (trabecular bone) are expected. This finding may cause some to question whether a single continuum formulation of bone remodeling can predict both discontinuous far-field behavior and continuous near-field behavior. We describe a node-based implementation of current continuum bone remodeling theories which eliminates the spurious near-field discontinuities and preserves the anatomically correct far-field discontinuities, thus indicating that a single biological process may be at work in forming and maintaining both far-field and near-field morphologies.},

However, these properties only provide limited insight into the damage process given the complex mechanical nature of bone. In the current study, alternative measures of the damage process were investigated for machined human cortical bone specimens loaded under torsion. Seventy-two bone specimens from 6 human femurs were subjected to a series of torsional relaxation cycles in which damage was induced during a single relaxation cycle and the effects of damage on the elastic, yield, viscous, and failure properties were determined from pre- and post-damage relaxation cycles. The results revealed that degradation of all torsion properties exhibited a significant twist magnitude effect. However, the yield stress and strain, the relaxation rate, and the total relaxation exhibited 5-10 fold greater degradation than both strength and modulus, when residual strength tests were conducted at high shear strain rates. For the loading conditions examined in this study, the results indicated that the relaxation and yield properties of cortical bone are more sensitive to shear damage accumulation and better measures of the damage process than either strength or modulus. Further, the results reveal an important interaction between damage and the viscous behavior of bone which provides new insight into the effects of damage on bone mechanical properties.},

In 223 women, all vertebral levels, i.e., L2-L4 in the DXA scan and L1-L3 in the QCT scan, could be evaluated. Fifty-five women were diagnosed as having at least one mild fracture (age 67.9 +/- 6.5 years) and 168 women did not have any fractures (age 62.3 +/- 6.9 years). We derived three estimates of "volumetric bone density" from PA DXA (BMAD, BMAD*, and BMD*) and three from paired PA and lateral DXA (WA BMD, WA BMDHol, and eVBMD). While PA BMC and PA BMD were significantly correlated with height (r = 0.49 and r = 0.28) or weight (r = 0.38 and r = 0.37), QCT and the volumetric bone density estimates from paired PA and lateral scans were not (r = -0.083 to r = 0.050). BMAD, BMAD*, and BMD* correlated with weight but not height. The associations with vertebral fracture were stronger for QCT (odds ratio [QR] = 3.17; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.90-5.27), eVBMD (OR = 2.87; CI 1.80-4.57), WA BMDHol (OR = 2.86; CI 1.80-4.55) and WA-BMD (OR = 2.77; CI 1.75-4.39) than for BMAD*/BMD* (OR = 2.03; CI 1.32-3.12), BMAD (OR = 1.68; CI 1.14-2.48), lateral BMD (OR = 1.88; CI 1.28-2.77), standard PA BMD (OR = 1.47; CI 1.02-2.13) or PA BMC (OR = 1.22; CI 0.86-1.74). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for QCT and all estimates of volumetric BMD were significantly higher compared with standard PA BMD and PA BMC. We conclude that, like QCT, estimates of volumetric bone density from paired PA and lateral scans are unaffected by height and weight and are more strongly associated with vertebral fracture than standard PA BMD or BMC, or estimates of volumetric density that are solely based on PA DXA scans.},

In view of an increasing interest in ultrasonic methodology in the field of bone biomechanics, we tested the hypothesis that both R- and L-waves can be excited in trabecular bone using an acoustic microscope at 1 GHz and that their speeds (C(R) and C(L)) can be extracted from V(z)-curves, i.e. plots of lens output voltage as a function of the lens focal point position with respect to the specimen surface. In accordance with V(z)-curves theoretically synthesized on the basis of incident field theory, experimental curves for canine femoral trabecular bone showed evidence of both R- and L-waves in almost all regions of recording. The measured CR ranged between 1.93 and 2.07 km/s (mean +/- SD.: 2.00=0.06 km/s) and the C(L) ranged between 2.33 and 4.33 km/s (3.37+/-0.61 km/s). Knowledge of both speeds allowed computation of a number of material constants by means of simple theory of elasticity and assumptions of the material density. We found values of Poisson ratio (v) ranging from 0.14 to 0.32 (0.23+/-0.07). Young's modulus (E) from 15 to 22.8 GPa (19.9+/-2.5 GPa) and the shear modulus (G) from 7.6 to 8.9 GPa (8.4+/-0.5 GPa).

A total of 141 cubic trabecular bone specimens collected from autopsy material from 56 individuals without any known bone or metastatic diseases were used. Age variation was in the range of 14-91 years and a wide range of trabecular architecture was found. Each specimen was three-dimensionally reconstructed with a voxel size of either 20 or 25 microm. Using the detailed three-dimensional reconstructions as input for microstructural finite-element models, the complete elastic properties of the trabecular architecture were obtained and maximum and mean stiffness could be calculated. Volume fraction and true three-dimensional architectural measurements of connectivity density and surface density were determined. Connectivity density was determined in an unbiased manner by the Euler number, which is a topological property. Using multiple regression analysis it was found that volume fraction explained by far the greatest part (84\%-94\%) of the variation in both mean and maximum stiffness. When connectivity density and surface density were included, the correlations increased marginally to 89\%-95\%. Noticeably negative regression coefficients were found for connectivity density. The results suggest that, in normal cancellous bone, the connectivity density has very limited value for assessment of elastic properties by morphological variables, but if a relation exists then stiffness decreases with increasing connectivity.},

	abstract = {Two uncemented unicompartmental tibial components were examined for initial fixation stability. A conventional design that employed a single posteriorly angled peg was compared with a new design that was held in place by cancellous bone screws. The components were implanted into the medial condyles of 12 preserved human tibiae, and a cyclic load was first applied anteromedially and then posteromedially. The screwed implants failed at significantly higher loads (1634.8 +/- 121.6 N, mean +/- standard error of the mean) than the pegged implants (1103.3 +/- 152.0 N). On application of a 19.6-N preload, the screwed implants moved significantly less than the pegged implants. Although the differences in micromotion and subsidence were not always significant, there were definite trends. The screwed implants had much lower levels of temporary and permanent displacement compared with the pegged implants for all load levels from the initial load of 245.2 N up to and including the failure load. When the motion that resulted from moving the load from the anterior position to the posterior position was examined, the screwed implant's average total motion was less than 10 microns compared with almost 135 microns for the pegged implant after the 245.2-N load cycle. For the cycle before failure, the screwed implant's average motion increased to less than 29 microns, whereas the pegged implant's average total motion was almost 354 microns. From this information it appears clear that screws provide better initial fixation stability than angled pegs for uncemented unicondylar tibial components.},

	abstract = {Roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA) was developed to measure micromotion of an orthopaedic implant with respect to its surrounding bone. A disadvantage of conventional RSA is that it requires the implant to be marked with tantalum beads. This disadvantage can potentially be resolved with model-based RSA, whereby a 3D model of the implant is used for matching with the actual images and the assessment of position and rotation of the implant. In this study, a model-based RSA algorithm is presented and validated in phantom experiments. To investigate the influence of the accuracy of the implant models that were used for model-based RSA, we studied both computer aided design (CAD) models as well as models obtained by means of reversed engineering (RE) of the actual implant. The results demonstrate that the RE models provide more accurate results than the CAD models. If these RE models are derived from the very same implant, it is possible to achieve a maximum standard deviation of the error in the migration calculation of 0.06 mm for translations in x- and y-direction and 0.14 mm for the out of plane z-direction, respectively. For rotations about the y-axis, the standard deviation was about 0.1 degrees and for rotations about the x- and z-axis 0.05 degrees. Studies with clinical RSA-radiographs must prove that these results can also be reached in a clinical setting, making model-based RSA a possible alternative for marker-based RSA.},

	abstract = {For individualization of a biomechanical model, it is necessary to estimate the muscle attachments of the person to whom it is to be adapted. One of the methods to estimate muscle attachments is to use model transformations to transform a model with known muscle attachments to the bones of a person. We hypothesize that the location and shape of muscle attachment sites correlate with the shape of the bones they are attached to. If this hypothesis holds, it is possible to predict the location of muscle attachments when the shape of the bones is known. To validate this hypothesis, geometric models of three sets of shoulder bones were built. These models consist of 3-D surface models of the scapula, clavicle, and humerus, with the muscle attachment contours connected to them. By means of geometric transformations, the models were transformed, so the muscle attachments of the different data sets could be compared. Using these techniques, 50 per cent of the muscle attachment contours could be predicted with high accuracy. The muscle attachment contours that could not be predicted were all influenced by measurement errors. For 30 per cent of the muscle attachment contours, it was not possible to distinguish the interindividual differences from the inaccuracies of the method used. From this study, we concluded that most muscle attachment contours can be predicted by means of geometric models of the bones.},

The method involves several steps including insertion of spheric tantalum markers, radiographic examinations, measurements of radiographic films, and calculations of three-dimensional movements. The precision of the method corresponding to the 99\% significance interval varies between 0.15 and 0.6 mm and 0.3 degree and 2 degrees when applied to total hip replacement depending on the technique used. Measurements of implant micromovement during 1 to 2 years after surgery have proved to be of value to predict later clinical failure because of aseptic loosening and revision. Subsidence of the femoral stem or proximal migration of the acetabular cup between 1 and 2 mm has indicated increased risk of early or intermediate term revisions in those prosthetic designs studied so far. Minimum early migration has been recorded for clinically well documented nonpolished stems and polyethylene cups, which probably is one explanation for their long term success. This small amount of early micromotion also has been found in porous coated and screw fixated press fit cups and all hydroxyapatite coated designs hitherto studied. As a first step in a clinical evaluation of new implants or surgical techniques, the predictive value of radiostereometric analysis measurements can be used to reduce the number of patients exposed to the potential risk of clinical failure.},

Although these properties depend very much on density, the role of architecture and tissue material properties remain uncertain. It is interesting that the strains at which the bone fails are almost independent of density. Current work addresses the underlying structure-function relations for such behavior, as well as more complex mechanical behavior, such as multiaxial loading, time-dependent failure, and damage accumulation. A unique tool for studying such behavior is the microstructural class of finite element models, particularly the "high-resolution" models. It is expected that with continued progress in this field, substantial insight will be gained into such important problems as osteoporosis, bone fracture, bone remodeling, and design/analysis of bone-implant systems.

Results of the simulations were analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Patterns of predicted bone loss corresponded very well with the DEXA measurements on the retrievals. The amount of predicted bone loss, measured quantitatively by simulating DEXA on finite element models, was found to be inversely correlated with the initial bone mineral content. It was concluded that the same clinically observed correlation can therefore be explained by mechanically induced remodelling.

	abstract = {In this work, we utilize the axial anatomical human male sections from the National Library of Medicine's Visible Human Project to generate three-dimensional (3-D) volume representations of the human male subject. The two-dimensional (2-D) projection images were produced by combining ray tracing techniques with automated image segmentation routines. The resultant images provide accurate and realistic volumetric representations of the Visible Human data set which is ultimately needed in medical virtual environment simulation. Ray tracing techniques provide methods by which 2-D volume views of a 3-D voxel array can be produced. The cross-sectional images can be scanned at different angles to produce rotated views of the voxel array. By combining volume views at incremental angles over 360 degrees a full volumetric representation of the voxel array, in this case the human male data set, can be computer generated and displayed without the speed and memory limitations of trying to display the entire data array. Additional texture and feature information can be obtained from the data by applying optical property equations to the ray scans. The imaging effects that can be added to volume renderings using these equations include shading, shadowing, and transparency. The automated segmentation routines provide a means to distinguish between various anatomical structures of the body. These routines can be used to differentiate between skin, fat, muscle, cartilage, blood vessels, and bone. By combining automated segmentation routines with the ray-tracing techniques, 2-D volume views of various anatomical structures and features can be isolated from the full data set. Examples of these segmentation abilities are demonstrated for the human male data set which include volume views of the skeletal systems, the musculoskeletal system, and part of the vascular system. The methods described above allow us to generate lifelike images, NURBS surface models, and realistic texture maps of specific anatomical structures. We have the capability to generate images that are both accurate and lifelike, much like photographic anatomical atlases. We can also generate images, models, and textures that have the clarity of medical artwork/illustrations, by highlighting the coloring of the ray traced structures with conventional colors instead of the natural color of the specimen. We are currently in the process of generating a comprehensive reference atlas of volume rendered images of the human body, soon to be published by Mosby-Year Book. The segmentation techniques needed to create this atlas also offer the accuracy and realism needed to create surface models and texture maps for a virtual environment for surgery simulation.},

	abstract = {Hip fracture, which is often due to osteoporosis or other conditions affecting bone strength, can lead to permanent disability, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and/or death. Great effort has been directed toward developing noninvasive methods for evaluating proximal femoral strength (fracture load), with the goal of assessing fracture risk. Previously, computed tomographic scan-based, linear finite element (FE) models were used to estimate proximal femoral fracture loads ex vivo in two load configurations, one approximating joint loading during single-limb stance and the other simulating impact from a fall. Measured and computed fracture loads were correlated (stance, r=0.867; fall, r=0.949). However, precision for the stance configuration was insufficient to identify subjects with below average fracture loads reliably. The present study examined whether, for this configuration, nonlinear FE models could be used to identify these subjects. These models were found to predict fracture load within +/-2.0 kN (r=0.962). This level of precision is sufficient to identify 97.5\% of femora with fracture loads 1.3 standard deviations below the mean as having below average fracture loads. Accordingly, 20\% of subjects with below average fracture loads, i.e. those with the lowest fracture loads and likely to be at greatest risk of fracture, would be correctly identified with at least 97.5\% reliability. This FE modeling method will be a powerful tool for studies of hip fracture.},

A new, automated method of generating patient-specific three-dimensional finite element models of bone is presented–it uses digital computed tomographic (CT) scan data to drive the geometry of the bone and to estimate its inhomogeneous material properties. Cubic elements of a user-specified size are automatically defined and then individually assigned the CT scan-derived material properties. The method is demonstrated by predicting the stress, stain, and strain energy in a human proximal femur in vivo. Three-dimensional loading conditions corresponding to the stance phase of gait were taken from the literature and applied to the model. Maximum principal compressive stresses of 8-23 MPa were computed for the medial femoral neck. Automated generation of additional finite element models with larger numbers of elements was used to verify convergence in strain energy.},

	abstract = {Hip fracture is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among the elderly. Current methods of assessing a patient's risk of hip fracture involve local estimates of bone density (densitometry), and are limited by their inability to account for the complex structural features of the femur. In an effort to improve clinical and research tools for assessing hip fracture risk, this study investigated whether automatically generated, computed tomographic (CT) scan-based finite element (FE) models can be used to estimate femoral fracture load in vitro. Eighteen pairs of femora were examined under two loading conditions one similar to loading during the stance phase of gait, and one simulating impact from a fall. The femora were then mechanically tested to failure and regression analyses between measured fracture load and FE-predicted fracture load were performed. For comparison, densitometry measures were also examined. Significant relationships were found between measured fracture load and FE-predicted fracture load (r = 0.87, stance; r = 0.95, fall; r = 0.97, stance and fall data pooled) and between measured fracture load and densitometry data (r = 0.78, stance; r = 0.91, fall). These results indicate that this sophisticated technique, which is still early in its development, can achieve precision comparable to that of densitometry and can predict femoral fracture load to within -40\% to +60\% with 95\% confidence. Therefore, clinical use of this approach, which would require additional X-ray exposure and expenditure for a CT scan, is not justified at this point. Even so, the potential advantages of this CT/FE technique support further research in this area.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate both the age and gender related distributions of bone mineral density in the proximal tibia, specifically in aged patients. BACKGROUND: For surgeons to achieve stable long-term fixation of implants in the proximal tibia, the distribution of bone mineral density must first be known. The changes that occur due to age or gender can alter these distributions. METHODS: Quantitative computed tomography and indentation testing were used to investigate 40 human tibiae (27 female, 13 male, average age 63.3 years). RESULTS: A significant reduction in bone mineral density was found in female tibiae between the age groups of {\textless} 60 and {\textgreater} or =60. This difference was not found in the male groups and no other significant difference was found between consecutive age groups. A three-dimensional map of the bone mineral density of the proximal tibia is therefore presented for the groups female {\textless} 60, female {\textgreater} or =60 and male. Reduced bone mineral density was consistently found in the central regions, whilst the regions of highest bone quality varied from postero-lateral to postero-medial. CONCLUSIONS: Implant fixation for fracture treatment as well as joint replacement of the proximal tibia are now able to take the regions of both high and low bone mineral density into consideration in older patients and those suffering from osteoporosis. RELEVANCE: Knowledge regarding the regional distribution of bone mineral density in the proximal tibia is necessary in order to achieve stable primary and long-term fixation of implants. This manuscript documents the bone mineral density changes that occur with age and gender.},

	abstract = {Hip structural analysis (HSA) is a technique for extracting strength-related structural dimensions of bone cross-sections from two-dimensional hip scan images acquired by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanners. Heretofore the precision of the method has not been thoroughly tested in the clinical setting. Using paired scans from two large clinical trials involving a range of different DXA machines, this study reports the first precision analysis of HSA variables, in comparison with that of conventional bone mineral density (BMD) on the same scans. A key HSA variable, section modulus (Z), biomechanically indicative of bone strength during bending, had a short-term precision percentage coefficient of variation (CV\%) in the femoral neck of 3.4-10.1\%, depending on the manufacturer or model of the DXA equipment. Cross-sectional area (CSA), a determinant of bone strength during axial loading and closely aligned with conventional DXA bone mineral content, had a range of CV\% from 2.8\% to 7.9\%. Poorer precision was associated with inadequate inclusion of the femoral shaft or femoral head in the DXA-scanned hip region. Precision of HSA-derived BMD varied between 2.4\% and 6.4\%. Precision of DXA manufacturer-derived BMD varied between 1.9\% and 3.4\%, arising from the larger analysis region of interest (ROI). The precision of HSA variables was not generally dependent on magnitude, subject height, weight, or conventional femoral neck densitometric variables. The generally poorer precision of key HSA variables in comparison with conventional DXA-derived BMD highlights the critical roles played by correct limb repositioning and choice of an adequate and appropriately positioned ROI.},

This mode of failure was related to inadequate support of the prosthetic posterior condyle, which resulted from inaccurate surgical cuts, poor cementing technique, or deficient bone stock either primary or secondary to persistent rheumatoid synovitis. Newer prosthetic designs that allow for greater range of motion and maximal function will further test the critical posterior condylar bone interface, as a result of which a higher incidence of femoral component loosening with flexion shift may be seen. Femoral component design changes and surgical techniques that sustain the posterior femoral condyle metal-bone interface may thus be necessary. Femoral components with intramedullary stems may be appropriate for high-risk patients.},

By taking advantage of the high intensity, collimation, and monochromaticity of synchrotron radiation, we have been able to image the three-dimensional trabecular bone structure in living rats, thus providing serial data on the earliest architectural changes that occur with estrogen loss. Results from these in vivo animal experiments demonstrate that one of the earliest manifestations of estrogen loss, in addition to a decrease in the amount of trabecular bone, is decreased connectivity. We demonstrate that estrogen replacement therapy, when initiated soon after significant changes have occurred, restores bone mass to baseline levels but does not recover the trabecular connectivity. Even without an associated recovery in trabecular connectivity, finite element calculations on the three-dimensional images suggest that estrogen recovers the original structural modulus of elasticity. We believe the recovery of the elastic properties is due to an increase in trabecular thickness above baseline values.},

	abstract = {Effects of canine hip replacement (with a porous-coated femoral component) on the material properties of surrounding cortical bone were evaluated. The hypotheses were: (1) after four months of implantation, mechanical properties of the cortex would change, and (2) a collared implant would be associated with smaller changes than a collarless design. Unilateral total hip arthroplasty was performed in 15 mixed-breed dogs. Nine received a collared and six received a collarless femoral component. Four months after implantation, longitudinal ultrasonic wave propagation velocities and bone mineral densities (from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) were measured in harvested femora and used to calculate the axial elastic constitutive coefficients for the cortex surrounding the implants. Results showed no difference in bone elasticity or bone density between collared and collarless designs. Significant velocity decreases from control values (p {\textless} 0.0001) were noted in all implanted femora at four months. Bone mineral densities also displayed decreased values after four months of implantation (p {\textless} 0.0145). Elastic coefficients were consistently less after four months of implantation when compared to control values (p {\textless} 0.0001). This alteration in material properties would affect load transfer into the implanted femur via the increased disparity between implant and bone stiffnesses regardless of the component design. Significant differences in the elastic coefficients between implanted and control femora support hypothesis 1. However, no group differences were found between collared and collarless implantations; thus, the study does not support hypothesis 2.},

	abstract = {The mechanical performance of cancellous bone is characterized using experiments which apply linear poroelasticity theory. It is hypothesized that the anisotropic organization of the solid and pore volumes of cancellous bone can be physically characterized separately (no deformable boundary interactive effects) within the same bone sample. Due to its spongy construction, the in vivo mechanical function of cancellous or trabecular bone is dependent upon fluid and solid materials which may interact in a hydraulic, convective fashion during functional loading. This project provides insight into the organization of the tissue, ie., the trabecular connectivity, by defining the separate nature of this biphasic performance. Previous fluid flow experiments [Kohles et al., 2001, Journal of Biomechanics, 34(11), pp. 1197-1202] describe the pore space via orthotropic permeability. Ultrasonic wave propagation through the trabecular network is used to describe the solid component via orthotropic elastic moduli and material stiffness coefficients. The linear poroelastic nature of the tissue is further described by relating transport (fluid flow) and elasticity (trabecular load transmission) during regression analysis. In addition, an empirical relationship between permeability and porosity is applied to the collected data. Mean parameters in the superior-inferior (SI) orientation of cubic samples (n=20) harvested from a single bovine distal femur were the largest (p{\textless}0.05) in comparison to medial-lateral (ML) and anterior-posterior (AP) orientations: Apparent elastic modulus (2,139 MPa), permeability (4.65x10(-10) m2), and material stiffness coefficient (13.6 GPa). A negative correlation between permeability as a predictor of structural elastic modulus supported a parametric relationship in the ML (R2=0.4793), AP (R2=0.3018), and SI (R2=0.6445) directions (p{\textless}0.05).},

Randomly located 45 microm mineralized nodules were used as the initial condition for the model simulations to represent an early stage of intramembranous bone formation. Boundary conditions were applied consistent with the mechanical environment provided by the in vivo bone chamber model. A two-dimensional repair simulation algorithim that incorporated strain energy density (SED), SED gradient, principal strain, or principal strain gradient as the local objective criterion was utilized to simulate the formation of an oriented trabecular bone microstructure. The simulation solutions were convergent, unique, and relatively insensitive to the assumed initial distribution of mineralized nodules. Model predictions of trabecular bone morphology and anisotropy were quantitatively compared to experimental results. All simulations produced structures that qualitatively resembled oriented trabecular bone. However only simulations utilizing a gradient objective criterion yielded results quantitatively similar to in vivo observations. This simulation approach coupled with an experimental model that delivers controlled in vivo mechanical stimuli can be utilized to study the relationship between physical factors and microstructural adaptation during bone repair.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to report our quantitative computed tomography (QCT) density-mechanical property regressions for trabecular bone for use in biomechanical modelling of the human spine. Cylindrical specimens of human vertebral trabecular bone (from T10 to L4) were cored from 32 cadavers (mean +/- SD age = 70.1 +/- 16.8; 13 females, 19 males) and scanned using QCT. Mechanical tests were conducted using a protocol that minimized end-artifacts over the apparent density range tested (0.09-0.38 g/cm3). To account for the presence of multiple specimens per donor in this data set, donor was treated as a random effect in the regression model. Mean modulus (319 +/- 189 MPa) was higher and mean yield strain (0.78 +/- 0.06\%) was lower than typical values reported previously due to minimization of the end-artifact errors. QCT density showed a strong positive correlation with modulus (n = 76) and yield stress (r2 = 0.90-0.95, n = 53, p {\textless} 0.001). There was a weak positive linear correlation with yield strain (r2 = 0.58, n = 53, p = 0.07). Prediction errors, incurred when estimating modulus or strength for specimens from a new donor, were 30-36\% of the mean values of these properties. Direct QCT density-mechanical property regressions gave more precise predictions of mechanical properties than if physically measured wet apparent density was used as an intermediate variable to predict mechanical properties from QCT density. Use of these QCT density-mechanical property regressions should improve the fidelity of QCT-based biomechanical models of the human spine for whole bone and bone-implant analyses.},

	abstract = {The effect of mineral volume fraction on the tensile mechanical properties of cortical bone tissue is investigated by theoretical and experimental means. The mineral content of plexiform, bovine bone was lowered by 18\% and 29\% by immersion in fluoride solutions for 3 days and 12 days, respectively. The elastic modulus, yield strength and ultimate strength of bone tissue decreased, while the ultimate strain increased with a decrease in mineral content. The mechanical behavior of bone tissue was modeled by using a micromechanical shear lag theory consisting of overlapped mineral platelets reinforcing the organic matrix. The decrease in yield stress, by the 0.002 offset method, of the fluoride treated bones were matched in the theoretical curves by lowering the shear yield stress of the organic matrix. The failure criterion used was based on failure stresses determined from a failure envelope (Mohr's circle), which was constructed using experimental data. It was found that the model predictions of elastic modulus got worse with a decrease in mineral content (being 7.9\%, 17.2\% and 33.0\% higher for the control, 3-day and 12-day fluoride-treated bones). As a result, the developed theory could not fully predict the yield strain of bones with lowered mineral content, being 12.9\% and 21.7\% lower than the experimental values. The predicted ultimate stresses of the bone tissues with lower mineral contents were within +/- 10\% of the experimental values while the ultimate strains were 12.7\% and 26.3\% lower than the experimental values. Although the model developed in this study did not take into account the presence of hierarchical structures, voids, orientation of collagen molecules and micro cracks, it still indicated that the mechanical properties of the organic matrix depend on bone mineral content.},

Known limitations of experimental methods as well as of the micro-FE techniques make the analysis and homogenization of 'equivalent' trabecular microstructures an advantageous tool for this task. In this study, parameterized orthotropic constitutive models of cancellous bone are derived from finite element analysis of repeatable microstructure cells. Two cell types are analysed: cube- and prism-based. The models are fully three-dimensional, have realistic curvilinear shapes and are parameterized with three shape parameters. Variation of the parameters allows to imitate most of the typical microstructure patterns observed in real bones, along with variety of intermediate geometries. Finite element models of cells are generated by a special-purpose structured mesh generator for any arbitrary set of shape parameter values. Six static numerical tests are performed for an exhaustive number of parameter value sets (microstructure instances). Multi-point boundary conditions imposed on the models ensure mutual fitting of deformed neighbouring cells. Values of computed stresses allow to determine all coefficients of elastic orthotropic stiffness matrix. Results have a form of tabularized functions of elastic constants versus the shape parameters. Comparison of the results with micro-FE data obtained for a large set of cancellous bone specimens proves a good agreement, though evidently better in the case of the prism-based cell model.},

(Transactions of the 32nd Annual Meeting of the Orthopaedic Research Society, Vol. 11, p. 42, 1986). Quantitative similarities existed in the fraction of components comprising the trabecular tissue of the two species. Qualitative similarities were seen in the positional and anisotropic variation of the mechanical properties, and also in the form and strength of the relationships between the mean modulus and bone density, ultimate stress and density, and ultimate stress and modulus. However, significantly different regression equations resulted for the mean modulus-density, and ultimate stress modulus relationships, indicating that for the same density, canine trabecular bone displays a lower modulus than human, and may achieve greater compressive strains before failure.},

The stereologic measures of bone volume fraction (PP) and trabecular plate density (PL) were used to quantify the comparisons. The results showed that the micro-CT measures of PP were not significantly different from those measured from histologic sections and therefore were very accurate. Measures of PL were different by approximately 14\%, which translated into discrepancies in trabecular plate thicknesses of about 19 microns. This difference was significantly correlated to the microstructural characteristics of the specific specimen scanned. The precision of both measurements was excellent.},

In 11 of the 14 specimens with radiolucencies, histological examination showed that the radiolucent areas represented regions of osteoporosis and bone remodelling. The remodelling changes were characterised by osteoporosis, cancellisation and thinning of the endosteal cortex, and osteopenia of the trabecular bone. In two specimens the appearance of radiolucency was found to be due to fibrous tissue at the cement-bone interface and in one specimen there was a mixed picture of osteolysis and fibrosis.

	abstract = {Although micromechanical finite-element models are being increasingly used to help interpret the results of bio-mechanical tests, there has not yet been a systematic study of the numerical errors and uncertainties that occur with these methods. In this work, finite-element models of human L1 vertebra have been used to analyze the sensitivity of the calculated elastic moduli to resolution, boundary conditions, and variations in the Poisson's ratio of the tissue material. Our results indicate that discretization of the bone architecture, inherent in the tomography process, leads to an underestimate in the calculated elastic moduli of about 20\% at 20 microm resolution; these errors vary roughly linearly with the size of the image voxels. However, it turns out that there is a cancellation of errors between the softening introduced by the discretization of the bone architecture and the excess bending resistance of eight-node hexahedral finite elements. Our empirical finding is that eight-node cubic elements of the same size as the image voxels lead to the most accurate calculation for a given number of elements, with errors of less than 5\% at 20 microm resolution. Comparisons with mechanical testing are also hindered by uncertainties in the grip conditions: our results show that these uncertainties are of comparable magnitude to the systematic differences in mechanical testing methods. Both discretization errors and uncertainties in grip conditions have a smaller effect on relative moduli, used when comparing between different specimens or different load directions, than on an absolute modulus. The effects of variations in the Poisson's ratio of the bone tissue were found to be negligible.},

	abstract = {Experimental data (Thornton et al., 1997) show that relaxation proceeds more rapidly (a greater slope on a log-log scale) than creep in ligament, a fact not explained by linear viscoelasticity. An interrelation between creep and relaxation is therefore developed for ligaments based on a single-integral nonlinear superposition model. This interrelation differs from the convolution relation obtained by Laplace transforms for linear materials. We demonstrate via continuum concepts of nonlinear viscoelasticity that such a difference in rate between creep and relaxation phenomenologically occurs when the nonlinearity is of a strain-stiffening type, i.e., the stress-strain curve is concave up as observed in ligament. We also show that it is inconsistent to assume a Fung-type constitutive law (Fung, 1972) for both creep and relaxation. Using the published data of Thornton et al. (1997), the nonlinear interrelation developed herein predicts creep behavior from relaxation data well (R {\textgreater} or = 0.998). Although data are limited and the causal mechanisms associated with viscoelastic tissue behavior are complex, continuum concepts demonstrated here appear capable of interrelating creep and relaxation with fidelity.},

METHOD: Volumetric CT scans of L1 and L2 (GE-9800Q; 80 kVp, 140 mAs, 3 mm slices) were acquired in a cohort of 62 osteoporotic women (mean age 70.4 years, T(DXA hip or spine) {\textless} -2.5), of whom 20 had vertebral fractures and 42 were nonfractured control subjects. An image analysis technique delineated trabecular, cortical, and integral regions in reference to a vertebra-fixed coordinate system. We computed precision values and fracture control differences for these new regions and for single-slice QCT and dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measures synthesized from the volumetric data. RESULTS: Volumetric trabecular BMD showed higher precision (1.3\%) than the synthesized single-slice measures (2.1-2.8\%). Volumetric and single-slice trabecular BMD showed equivalent decrements between fractured and nonfractured subjects (17-19\%), with integral BMD showing smaller and less significant differences (7-8\%). CONCLUSION: Volumetric and single-slice QCT techniques are equivalent for vertebral fracture risk estimation, but volumetric techniques should be superior for monitoring therapy efficacy.},

This study is aimed at developing a special CT scanning protocol for the hip region that can be adopted in clinical practise for 3-D pre-operative planning of total hip replacement surgery. Optimisation of CT acquisition parameters is investigated for both axial and spiral CT and the two resulting protocols are compared in terms of effective radiation dose to the patient. Results show that spiral CT with D=3 and P=1.5 in regions with higher morphological and density gradients and D=5 and P=1.5 in regions where the morphology is more regular degrades the image quality slightly but allows acquisition of a higher number of images at comparable costs, increasing the longitudinal resolution of the acquired data set. The effective dose is comparable to that of a standard pelvic CT exam. Adjusting the axial CT scan parameters the effective dose can be reduced, however lowering the accuracy of 3-D bone geometry reconstruction.},

Elementary objects were used to model ligaments, articular surfaces, retinacula and muscle-tendon units. The performance of several pairs of prosthetic articular surfaces was also analysed. According to the results of these simulations, rolling as well as sliding motion occurs in the natural ankle, governed by a ligamentous linkage.

	abstract = {A two-dimensional four-bar linkage model of the ankle joint is formulated to describe dorsi/plantarflexion in unloaded conditions as observed in passive tests on ankle complex specimens. The experiments demonstrated that the human ankle joint complex behaves as a single-degree-of-freedom system during passive motion, with a moving axis of rotation. The bulk of the movement occurred at the level of the ankle. Fibres within the calcaneofibular and tibiocalcaneal ligaments remained approximately isometric. The experiments showed that passive kinematics of the ankle complex is governed only by the articular surfaces and the ligaments. It was deduced that the ankle is a single-degree-of-freedom mechanism where mobility is allowed by the sliding of the articular surfaces upon each other and the isometric rotation of two ligaments about their origins and insertions, without tissue deformation. The linkage model is formed by the tibia/fibula and talus/calcaneus bone segments and by the calcaneofibular and tibiocalcaneal ligament segments. The model predicts the path of calcaneus motion, ligament orientations, instantaneous axis of rotation, and conjugate talus surface profile as observed in the experiments. Many features of ankle kinematics such as rolling and multiaxial rotation are elucidated. The geometrical model is a necessary preliminary step to the study of ankle joint stability in response to applied loads and can be used to predict the effects of changes to the original geometry of the intact joint. Careful reconstruction of the original geometry of the ligaments is necessary after injury or during total ankle replacement.},

METHODS: The FE model took into consideration poroelasticity of the IVD and viscoelasticity of the annulus fibers and ligaments to predict the time-dependent behavior. To simulate a holding task, the motion segment was subjected to a combined loading of constant compressive load (1600 N) and anterior shear (200 N) for 2 hours, and the role of facet joints and ligaments in the biomechanical response was investigated by removal of unilateral/bilateral facets, posterior ligaments (supraspinous and interspinous), and facets and ligaments. RESULTS: The results show the stabilizing role of the facets and ligaments in resisting anterior shear and sagittal rotation under combined loading over time. The main pathway of fluid movement was found to permeate through the central region of the endplate, and the fluid diffusion occurred earlier at the posterior nucleus than the anterior nucleus. The fluid loss from the nucleus dictated the time-dependent motion under the sustained loading, whereas the intrinsic properties of ligaments/annulus fibers played a role only in the early stage of the loading. CONCLUSION: The predicted results using poroelastic elements provide new insight into the IVD in providing the spinal stiffness under combined loading.},

The current project is a FE analysis based on a retrospective computerized tomography (CT) in vivo data set of 11 patients 12 years after THA. In order to control the analysis, a computationally created stem was implanted at the femur model of the not operated contralateral side. In comparison to the not operated side, there was a significant reduction of the strain energy density (SED) values in all regions of interest (ROI) with the greatest effect near the distal tip of the stem. Only zone 1 showed no clear trend which may be due to load application at the greater trochanter causing local strain peaks. The median SED values changed by -31.65\% (ROI 1), -25.64\% (ROI 2), -30.82\% (ROI 3), -12.35\% (ROI 4), -40.10\% (ROI 5), -30.37\% (ROI 6) and -43.38\% (ROI 7). As far as we are aware, the current combination of in vivo CT density data with FE strain analyses after THA is based on the largest number of patients and the longest follow-up period. This combination enables analysis and prediction of the influence of implantation upon bone and can be compared with of remodelling theories. The assessment of mechanical strain data during a follow-up trial could be a new approach for analyzing different hip stems in clinical biomechanics.},

	volume = {25},
	abstract = {The majority of cemented femoral hip replacements fail as a consequence of loosening. One design feature that may affect loosening rates is implant surface finish. To determine whether or not surface finish effects fatigue damage accumulation in a bone cement mantle, we developed an experimental model of the implanted proximal femur that allows visualisation of damage growth in the cement layer. Five matte surface and five polished surface stems were tested. Pre-load damage and damage after two million cycles was measured. Levels of pre-load (shrinkage) damage were the same for both matte and polished stems; furthermore damage for matte vs. polished stems was not significantly different after two million cycles. This was due to the large variability in damage accumulation rates. Finite element analysis showed that the stress is higher for the polished (assumed debonded) stem, and therefore we must conclude that either the magnitude of the stress increase is not enough to appreciably increase the damage accumulation rate or, alternatively, the polished stem does not debond immediately from the cement. Significantly (P=0.05) more damage was initiated in the lateral cement compared to the medial cement for both kinds of surface finish. It was concluded that, despite the higher cement stresses with debonded stems, polished prostheses do not provoke the damage accumulation failure scenario.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine several simple ex vivo loading conditions for the equine metacarpus, and to evaluate their ability to reproduce the mid-diaphyseal bone surface strain distributions previously reported in vivo at the walk and trot. Distributed axial compressive loads, and 9 different axial compressive point loads at -7.5kN and -15kN were applied to metacarpal-distal carpal bone preparations from 6 Thoroughbred horses, aged 1 - 5 years. The resulting dorsal, medial, palmar, and lateral mid-diaphyseal bone surface axial and shear strains were compared with previously reported in vivo surface strain distributions using root mean square error (RSME) protocol. The effects of loading condition and load magnitude on RSME were assessed with a mixed-model analysis of variance. There were significant differenced between loading conditions, and, in most cases, between load magnitudes, in the fit of the ex vivo to the in vivo strain distributions. In vivo mid-diaphyseal bone surface strain distributions at the walk can be well approximated ex vivo by a distributed axial compressive load, or by a point load positioned 0.5 cm mediad to the sagittal midline, at -7.5 kN loads. In vivo mid-diaphyseal bone surface strain distributions at the trot can be well approximated by the -15 kN loads applied to the same locations. These simplified loading conditions can be used in designing biologically relevant loading protocols for ex vivo mechanical testing studies, as well as in developing boundary conditions for finite element analysis. Ash such, these loading conditions may be considered as tools to be used as a means of replicating in vivo loading conditions during the initial design and testing stages in the development of a fracture fixation devices, as well as in the theoretical mechanical analysis of the metacarpal structure.},

	abstract = {The concept that bone responds to a time-averaged value of its current mechanical loading forms the basis for many computational bone adaptation algorithms. Some mathematical formulations have incorporated a quantification of the loading experienced during a single "average" day and thus implicitly assume that bone responds abruptly to changes in its loading history. To better reflect the time delays inherent in bone cell recruitment and activation processes, we included a fading memory of past loading. Implementing an exponentially fading memory with time constants of 5, 20, and 100 days, we simulated bone adaptations to abrupt and gradual changes in mechanical loading. Both an idealized single degree-of-freedom model and a finite element model of the proximal femur were studied. A time constant of 5 days produced time-dependent density changes that were negligibly different from those of the standard approach without memory. Models with higher time constants produced significant transient time lags (up to 8.1\% difference) in the predicted short-term (3 months) bone density changes. A time constant of 100 days produced overshoots (by approximately 1\%) of the eventual steady-state. All models predicted comparable long-term (after several years) steady-state adaptations. Future experimental analyses will be necessary to better determine appropriate fading memory time constants for bone under various loading conditions.},

For this purpose, two models were examined. One was of an elastomeric metacarpophalangeal joint implant, with the material being assumed to have isotropic elastic properties in one case while it was represented as hyperelastic in the other. The model used in the second study case was that of a construct comprising the tibial component of a total knee replacement, the associated tibial insert, the resected bones, and the acrylic bone cement layer. In one analysis of this model, all the materials were taken to have isotropic elastic properties, while in the other analysis, the cortical bone was represented as transversely isotropic, with all other materials being considered to have isotropic elastic properties.

	abstract = {The question of whether prosthesis/abutment tooth interface debonding is associated with inappropriate occlusal force is investigated in this study. A new modeling approach was employed to perform the interfacial stress analyses. Solid models of resin-bonded (RB) prosthesis and abutment teeth were constructed by stacking serious section contours that were obtained from CT images. A 3-D finite element (FE) model of RB prosthesis/abutment teeth was generated in a CAD system after assembling and meshing procedures. An in-house program was developed to combine the FE package (ANSYS) to calculate the interfacial (normal and shear) stresses at the prosthesis/molar interface with the bonding and debonding conditions. After 10 different occlusal force(s) evaluations, three initial opening gaps at the distal margin of the retainer were assumed to examine the possible interface debonding mechanism under the worst loading case. The results indicated that a more accurate FE model of the posterior RB prosthesis/abutments could be generated through combining several computer-aided techniques. The maximum interfacial stresses were obtained when the occlusal force was applied on the buccal slope of the distolingual cusp of the molar. For interface debonding simulations, peak normal and shear stresses were found near the debonding areas and stress values increased gradually with small to large initial opening gaps. From these results, prosthesis/abutment tooth interfacial fatigue damage might arise or accelerate the interface to debond under adequate bonding or initial gap opening conditions after long-term repeated inappropriate occlusal force actions.},

	title = {Elastic and viscoelastic properties of trabecular bone by a compression testing approach},
	volume = {41},
	abstract = {In this review the advantages and disadvantages of different variants of compression testing of trabecular bone are discussed. Factors affecting the precision and the accuracy of mechanical properties of trabecular bone derived from such tests are analysed. Below are listed some of the important conclusions which can be drawn. Conclusions based on the author's previous studies (I-IX) are shown in italic. 1) Trabecular bone is a viscoelastic solid. 2) Stiffness, strength, ultimate strain, and failure energy are derived from a standard compression test to failure. Viscoelastic properties such as energy dissipation and the relative energy loss (loss tangent) can be obtained from non-destructive cyclic tests. 3) A non-destructive test conducted between a lower load level (zero strain) and an upper strain limit of about 0.8\% specimen strain has been developed. The reproducibility of such a test technique has been assessed at different conditions. The reproducibility was best after a number of conditioning cycles in order to achieve a viscoelastic steady state. Orthotropic properties can be determined by non-destructive testing in different directions of cubic specimens. The reproducibility of such testing has been established. 4) The stiffness derived from non-destructive tests will be lower than that obtained from a destructive test because of the non-linearity of the load-deformation curve, but the stiffnesses will be strongly correlated. 5) Stiffnesses derived from destructive and non-destructive tests have an elastic and a viscoelastic contribution. Since the viscoelastic contribution is time dependent, the results will be dependent on strain rate and loading frequency in cyclic tests. 6) Standard testing of small trabecular bone specimens is associated with systematic errors. The most significant of these errors are believed to be related to trabecular disintegrity at the surface of the specimen and to friction at the specimen-platen interface. Structural disintegrity causes an axial strain inhomogeneity resulting in a overestimation of axial strain and a corresponding underestimation of specimen stiffness. Friction at the interface causes an uneven stress and strain distribution in the layer nearest to the test platen resulting in a overestimation of stiffness. The net result of these systematic errors is a 20-40 per cent underestimation of stiffness. 7) The specimen geometry has a highly significant influence on mechanical properties such as stiffness, ultimate strain and energy absorption. A cube with a side length of 6.5 mm and a cylindrical specimen with a length of 6.5 mm and a diameter of 7.5 mm are suggested as standard geometries providing comparable results.},

Cylindrical specimens taken from the upper tibial epiphysis of autopsy knees were tested non-destructively by cyclic compression to 0.8\% strain under different conditions. Fixation of the specimens to the test columns by a thin layer of bone cement increased the stiffness by 40\% and reduced the energy dissipation to 67\% of those measured under unconstrained conditions (p less than 0.001). The thin cement layer alone increased the stiffness 19\% and reduced energy dissipation to 86\% (n.s.). When the machine was equipped with polished steel columns coated by a film of low-viscous oil, both the stiffness and the energy dissipation were reduced to 93\% of those measured under standard conditions (p less than 0.005). Trabecular bone specimens tested side-constrained by the surrounding trabecular bone (in situ) showed a 19\% larger stiffness than that measured during later testing of the corresponding machined specimens (p less than 0.005) whereas the energy dissipation was not altered significantly.

The variations of strength and stiffness were explained equally well by the linear and the power function relationship to strain rate. The exponent was 0.07 in the power function relationship between strength and strain rate and 0.05 between stiffness and strain rate. The variation of ultimate strain was explained best using a power function relationship to strain rate (exponent = 0.03). The variation of strength and stiffness was explained equally well by the linear, power function and quadratic relationship to apparent density. The cubic relationship between stiffness and apparent density showed a less good fit. Ultimate strain varied independently of apparent density.},

	abstract = {Optical motion analysis techniques have been widely used in biomechanics for measuring large-scale motions such as gait, but have not yet been significantly explored for measuring smaller movements such as the tooth displacements under load. In principle, very accurate measurements could be possible and this could provide a valuable tool in many engineering applications. The aim of this study was to evaluate accuracy and repeatability of the Qualisys ProReflex-MCU120 system when measuring small displacements, as a step towards measuring tooth displacements to characterise the properties of the periodontal ligament. Accuracy and repeatability of the system was evaluated using a wedge comparator with a resolution of 0.25 microm to provide measured marker displacements in three orthogonal directions. The marker was moved in ten steps in each direction, for each of seven step sizes (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 20 microm), repeated five times. Spherical and diamond markers were tested. The system accuracy (i.e. percentage of maximum absolute error in range/measurement range), in the 20-200 microm ranges, was +/-1.17\%, +/-1.67\% and +/-1.31\% for the diamond marker in x, y and z directions, while the system accuracy for the spherical marker was +/-1.81\%, +/-2.37\% and +/-1.39\%. The system repeatability (i.e. maximum standard deviation in the measurement range) measured under the different days, light intensity and temperatures for five times, carried out step up and then step down measurements for the same step size, was +/-1.7, +/-2.3 and +/-1.9 microm for the diamond marker, and +/-2.6, +/-3.9 and +/-1.9 microm for the spherical marker in x, y and z directions, respectively. These results demonstrate that the system suffices accuracy for measuring tooth displacements and could potentially be useful in many other applications.},

	abstract = {Over 90 percent of the more than 250,000 hip fractures that occur annually in the United States are the result of falls from standing height. Despite this, the stresses associated with femoral fracture from a fall have not been investigated previously. Our objectives were to use three-dimensional finite element models of the proximal femur (with geometries and material properties based directly on quantitative computed tomography) to compare predicted stress distributions for one-legged stance and for a fall to the lateral greater trochanter. We also wished to test the correspondence between model predictions and in vitro strain gage data and failure loads for cadaveric femora subjected to these loading conditions. An additional goal was to use the model predictions to compare the sensitivity of several imaging sites in the proximal femur which are used for the in vivo prediction of hip fracture risk. In this first of two parts, linear finite element models of two unpaired human cadaveric femora were generated. In Part II, the models were extended to include nonlinear material properties for the cortical and trabecular bone. While there was poor correspondence between strain gage data and model predictions, there was excellent agreement between the in vitro failure data and the linear model, especially using a von Mises effective strain failure criterion. Both the onset of structural yielding (within 22 and 4 percent) and the load at fracture (within 8 and 5 percent) were predicted accurately for the two femora tested. For the simulation of one-legged stance, the peak stresses occurred in the primary compressive trabeculae of the subcapital region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

These models demonstrated excellent agreement with in vitro studies when used to predict ultimate failure loads. In Part II, we report our extension of those finite element models to include nonlinear behavior of the trabecular and cortical bone. A highly nonlinear material law, originally designed for representing concrete, was used for trabecular bone, while a bilinear material law was used for cortical bone. We found excellent agreement between the model predictions and in vitro fracture data for both the onset of bone yielding and bone fracture. For bone yielding, the model predictions were within 2 percent for a load which simulated one-legged stance and 1 percent for a load which simulated a fall. For bone fracture, the model predictions were within 1 percent and 17 percent, respectively. The models also demonstrated different fracture mechanisms for the two different loading configurations. For one-legged stance, failure within the primary compressive trabeculae at the subcapital region occurred first, leading to load transfer and, ultimately, failure of the surrounding cortical shell. However, for a fall, failure of the cortical and trabecular bone occurred simultaneously within the intertrochanteric region. These results support our previous findings that the strength of the subcapital region is primarily due to trabecular bone whereas the strength of the intertrochanteric region is primarily due to cortical bone.},

	title = {Measurement of the migration of a cemented hip prosthesis in an in vitro test},
	volume = {16},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a method to measure the migration of a cemented hip prosthesis in an in vitro experimental test. DESIGN: A device to measure prosthesis movement relative to bone was designed and fabricated. It was tested using a Lubinus prosthesis (W. Link, Germany) implanted in a composite femur. BACKGROUND: Clinical studies using radiostereophotogrammetry have shown that those cemented hip prosthesis that migrate rapidly in the first two post-operative years are the ones that require early revision. If migration be used as a basis for a pre-clinical test, then it should be possible to screen-out inferior designs before implantation in animal or clinical trials. METHODS: The micromotion measurement device consisted of a 'target' of three spheres arranged in a cruciform structure. Six linear variable displacement transducers were aligned with the spheres so that motion of the prosthesis relative to the bone could be measured. RESULTS: The displacement and rotation of the prosthesis relative to the composite femur was recorded for two million cycles. Relative rapid initial migration was found, followed by a period of steady-state migration. Distal migration (called 'subsidence' in this paper) of up to 0.1 mm was measured; however the variability in absolute prosthesis migration was very high despite efforts to ensure that all extraneous factors were minimised. In the majority of cases, the prostheses migrated medially, distally and anteriorly. The absolute subsidence, and its variability, were similar to that recorded clinically. CONCLUSIONS: A method has been designed and tested which measures prosthesis migration in an experimental test. It provides a basis for a pre-clinical testing standard. Relevance. Hip prostheses need to be tested experimentally before implantation. However, no reliable test exists for such experimental tests. Rapid migration of a cemented prosthesis relative to bone has been shown in vivo to correlate with early failure, and in this paper a method to make such migration measurements in vitro is described and tested.},

MR is a non-invasive technique for determining trabecular architecture both in vivo and in vitro. In this paper we review the use of magnetic resonance imaging to obtain high resolution images of trabecular bone structure and quantify the three-dimensional architecture of the trabecular bone network. Studies assessing the anisotropy of the trabecular architecture in human cadaveric specimens from the distal and proximal femur, and the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, are reviewed. The contributions of the MR derived measures of 3D trabecular bone structure to the biomechanical strength of the specimen are presented. In vivo, the relationship between the high resolution MR derived trabecular bone structure parameters in the distal radius and calcaneus in patients with hip fractures, are compared to age matched normal controls. MR derived measures are compared to measures of trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) in the hip using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).},

	abstract = {Mechanical failure of the cement-bone interface can contribute to clinical loosening of cemented total hip replacements. The conditions that cause loosening are poorly understood, in part, due to a lack of information on the mechanical behavior of the cement bone interface. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanical behavior of the cement-bone interface due to mixed-mode (combined tension and shear) loading and to develop a failure model for the cement bone interface. Laboratory tests of machined cement-bone test specimens were performed with mixed-mode loading conditions (loading angles of 22.5 degrees, 45 degrees, and 67.5 degrees) to determine the mechanical response in the pre-yield and post-yield state. After accounting for the quantity of interdigitated bone as a covariate, the mixed-mode data were combined with previous tension (0 degrees) and shear data (90 degrees) to develop a failure model for the cement bone interface. The strength of the interface was positively correlated with the quantity of interdigitated bone (r2 = 0.70, 0.53, 0.49, for 22.5 degrees, 45 degrees, and 67.5 degrees, respectively). There was a significant increase in failure strength (P {\textless} 0.001) with increasing mixed-mode angle. When all data were incorporated into an elliptical failure criterion, the average error between the actual and predicted strength was 33\%. These results can now be incorporated into constitutive models of the cement bone interface to determine the initiation and progression of interface failure in cemented total hip replacements.},

Micromovement between the tibial component and the screws and between the tibial component and the bone after the screws were removed also was measured in the cementless specimens. Minimal micromovement in most of the implants suggests that the tibial components were well fixed. Micromovement between the tibial tray and the screws also was minimal in the cementless components. Removing the screws did not significantly affect micromovement, except in the specimen retrieved 3 days after surgery and in the specimen with a complete radiolucent line under the component. The cementless tibial components fixed with screws, pegs, and stem were as stable as the component secured with cement.

The average normalized peak stress in dysplastic hips (7.1 kPa/N) was markedly higher (to approximately 100\%) than the average normalized peak stress in normal hips (3.5 kPa/N). The characteristic parameters that contributed to higher peak stress in dysplastic hips included the smaller lateral coverage of the femoral head, the larger interhip distance, the wider pelvis, and the medial position of the greater trochanter.

	abstract = {Biomechanical theories to predict bone remodelling have used either mechanical strain or microdamage as the stimulus driving cellular responses. Even though experimental data have implicated both stimuli in bone cell regulation, a mechano-regulatory system incorporating both stimuli has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that bone remodelling may be regulated by signals due to both strain and microdamage. Four mechano-regulation algorithms are studied where the stimulus is: strain, damage, combined strain/damage, and either strain or damage with damage-adaptive remodelling prioritised when damage is above a critical level. Each algorithm is implemented with both bone lining cell (surface) sensors and osteocyte cell (internal) sensors. Each algorithm is applied to prediction of a bone multicellular unit (BMU) remodelling on the surface of a bone trabecula. It is predicted that a regulatory system capable of responding to changes in either strain or microdamage but which prioritises removal of damaged bone when damage is above a critical level, is the only one that provides a plausible prediction of BMU behaviour. A mechanism for this may be that, below a certain damage threshold, osteocyte processes can sense changes in strain and fluid flow but above the threshold damage interferes with the signalling mechanism, or causes osteocyte apoptosis so that a remodelling response occurs to remove the dead osteocytes.},

	abstract = {A number of algorithms have been proposed to model the adaptive behavior of bone under load. However, the predictions of several models have neither been compared nor have they been systematically related to in vivo data. To this end, the stress states of loaded implant-bone interfaces were analyzed before and after osseointegration using finite element (FE) techniques. In a preliminary step, an FE mesh of a cylindrical implant encased in a cancellous core surrounded by a cortical layer was constructed, and the stresses and strains that developed at the interface were determined. The implant was loaded with 100 N vertical and 30 N lateral loads. Using this structure, the peak compressive and tensile stresses were determined. Then bone remodeling predictions were assessed using three different models: von Mises equivalent strain, strain energy density and effective stress. Finally, a systematic search of the literature was conducted to relate the numerical predictions to existing in vivo data. The FE simulations led to the following conclusions: (1) calculated compressive stresses were lower than the ultimate compressive stresses of cortical and cancellous bone. (2) Calculated tensile stresses were generally superior to experimental data on the tensile strength of the bone-implant interface. (3) With one exception, the predictions of all models were homogeneously grouped on the stimulus scales. (4) The predictions of the models as to bone gain or loss were not consistent and at times contradictory. It is hypothesized that this effect is linked to a lazy zone that is too narrow. With respect to the application of the numerical models to in vivo data, peak strains and strain energy densities were consistent with in vivo data. No in vivo data were found that supported effective stress as a stimulus.},

Machined aluminum and cortical bone specimens were used to test the accuracy and repeatability of the procedure. Manipulations of the finite element models were performed to examine the effect that mesh construction errors might have on the accuracy of the results. None of the parameters examined resulted in changes in the measured finite element displacements of greater than 8\%.

	abstract = {Proper isotropic and anisotropic friction constitutive equations are developed based on previous friction measurements at cancellous bone-porous coated implant interfaces exhibiting nonlinear load-displacement curves. The simulated friction response is dependent on relative tangential displacements in both orthogonal directions. The interface constitutive matrix contains cross-stiffness terms identical in isotropic friction but different in anisotropic friction. These terms are due mainly to nonlinearity in response and vanish in unidirectional friction along a principal direction and in cases with Coulomb or linear friction. The interface ultimate resistance is evaluated by an elliptic criterion which becomes circular in isotropic cases.These constitutive relations are implemented in a finite element program which is employed to analyze a bone cube sliding on top of a porous-surfaced metallic plate, an experimental model used in our earlier measurements. The results for both isotropic and anisotropic frictions demonstrate the coupling between two orthogonal directions. The direction of resultant displacement under a variable load coincides with that of the load only when the friction is isotropic with coupling terms considered. In anisotropic friction, the resultant displacement occurs in a direction different from that of loading. Our previous bi-directional measurements corroborate well the findings of this study.},

	abstract = {Although the concept of a total ankle arthroplasty has been advanced as a method for treating severe ankle arthritis, the clinical experience with all of the models developed has been discouraging. Both the constrained designs, which maximize joint contact area by restricting the available motion, and the unconstrained designs, which allow more normal motion at the expense of higher contact stresses, uniformly result in implant loosening, pain, and clinical failure in 2 to 7 years. This has led to the recommendation against the use of a total ankle arthroplasty except in very low-demand patients. Failure of ankle implants can be ascribed to either anatomic considerations (e.g.–the talus is too small to accommodate the stress transfers of a prosthesis), or mechanical etiologies. Abnormal 3-dimensional motion of the ankle following arthroplasty would fall into the latter category. This study examined the motion that occurs after implantation of an unconstrained-type total ankle arthroplasty. Using previously validated methodology, axially loaded ankle specimens were cycled through an arc of plantarflex/dorsiflexion while measuring the resulting coupled internal/external and varus/valgus rotations. The average coupled motions in prosthetic ankles were not significantly different than their intact controls. There was, however, a significantly increased amount of hysteresis (defined as the difference between the upper and lower pathways of coupled motion at any given sagittal position) that occurred as the ankle was dorsiflexed and plantar flexed. The increased hysteresis was seen in both the axial and coronal planes. This indicates that there was a greater permitted envelop of motion in the prosthetic ankles compared to normal ankles. It is hypothesized that this subtle change in ankle kinematics caused by the arthroplasty leads to abnormal stress transfer at the prosthesis-bone interface, thereby promoting early implant failure.},

Forty anatomic specimen tibiae were stress tested on a servohydraulic mechanical test machine to evaluate the effects of screws and a sleeve on initial fixation of the uncemented total knee tibial component. Twenty specimens were used for posteroanterior shear loading and 20 for anterolateral axial compressive loading. Four cancellous screws were inserted through holes of the tibial tray to pierce the cortex of the proximal tibia. The methylmethacrylate sleeve was applied to the central stem.

BACKGROUND: There are few reports on tibial tray mechanics with and without a posterior concave slot, using three-dimensional finite element analysis. METHODS: By considering two different shapes for the tibial component, we analyzed the von Mises stresses and displacements at the component/bone interface and surrounding bone using a three-dimensional finite element model. RESULTS: There was no difference between the two designs in regards to the von Mises stress fields or displacements. The displacement of the tibial tray with a posterior concave slot was less than that of the tray without one in some of the loading configurations. The posterior concave slot appears to reduce the micromotion of the tibial component. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Overall, this finite element analysis showed little difference between the two different types of tibial base plates used with both posterior cruciate ligament retention and substitution. The results of this finite element model analysis do not support the use of tibial base plates without a posterior cut-out slot.},

	volume = {19},
	abstract = {Using magnetic resonance imaging, men with spinal cord injury (n = 10) were found to have fewer trabeculae that were spaced further apart in the knee than able-bodied controls of similar age, height, and weight (n = 8). The deteriorated trabecular bone microarchitecture may contribute to the increased fracture incidence after injury. INTRODUCTION: Spinal cord injury results in a dramatic decline in areal bone mineral density (aBMD) and a marked increase in lower extremity fracture; however, its effect on trabecular bone microarchitecture is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine if trabecular bone microarchitecture is deteriorated in the knee of men with long-term, complete spinal cord injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apparent bone volume to total volume (appBV/TV), trabecular number, (appTb.N), trabecular thickness (appTb.Th), and trabecular separation (appTb.Sp), measures of trabecular bone microarchitecture, were assessed in the distal femur and proximal tibia of men with long-term ({\textgreater}2 years) complete spinal cord injury (SCI; n = 10) and able-bodied controls (CON; n = 8) using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Proximal tibia and arm aBMD were determined using DXA. Independent t-tests were used to assess group differences in anthropometrics and bone parameters. Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the relationships among trabecular bone microarchitecture, aBMD, and time since injury. RESULTS: There were no group differences in age, height, or weight; however, the distal femur and proximal tibia of SCI had 27\% and 20\% lower appBV/TV, 21\% and 20\% lower appTb.N, and 44\% and 33\% higher appTb.Sp, respectively (p {\textless} 0.05). The distal femur of SCI also had 8\% lower appTb.Th (p {\textless} 0.05). Whereas arm aBMD was not different in the two groups, proximal tibia aBMD was 43\% lower in SCI. In SCI and CON combined, aBMD was correlated with appBV/TV (r = 0.62), appTb.N (r = 0.78), and appTb.Sp (r = -0.82) in the proximal tibia (p {\textless} 0.05). Time since injury was more strongly correlated with appTb.N (r = -0.54) and appTb.Sp (r = 0.56) than aBMD (r = -0.36) in the distal tibia, although none of the relationships were statistically significant (p {\textgreater} 0.05). CONCLUSION: Men with complete spinal cord injury have markedly deteriorated trabecular bone microarchitecture in the knee, which may contribute to their increased fracture incidence.},

	abstract = {Objective. To investigate the extent of coupling between the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments as well as the role of the posterior cruciate ligament in the knee joint response under anterior femoral force at different flexion angles. Design. A developed finite element model of the tibiofemoral joint is used to perform non-linear elastostatic analyses. Background. The structural properties of the posterior cruciate ligament subsequent to an injury (either left untreated or replaced by a graft) would likely change, an event that alters the function of not only the ligament itself but also the other intact cruciate ligament and the entire joint. Methods. The model consists of two bony structures and their articular cartilage layers, menisci and four principal ligaments. Under 100 N anterior femoral load at different flexion angles from 0Â° to 90Â°, kinematics, forces in ligaments and contact forces in the fully unconstrained joint were computed in intact cases and following alterations in joint ligaments. Results. Collateral ligaments were the primary structures to resist the force at full extension under 100 N anterior femoral load with a moderate contribution from the posterior cruciate ligament. With joint flexion up to 90Â°, however, force in the posterior cruciate ligament substantially increased whereas that in collateral ligaments diminished. Conclusions. A remarkable coupling was found between the posterior cruciate ligament and the anterior cruciate ligament in flexion; a structural alteration in one of them significantly influenced the mechanical role of both ligaments and not just the one affected. A tauter or stiffer ligament increased the force in both ligaments while an excessive laxity or rupture in one diminished forces in both. Relevance Alterations in ligament stiffness or initial tautness during reconstruction surgery or following injuries markedly influence the normal role of both cruciate ligaments. Consideration of cruciate ligaments coupled together rather than in isolation should be the rule in the management of ligament injuries towards a successful long-term outcome.},

	abstract = {One outstanding issue regarding the relationship between elastic modulus and density for trabecular bone is whether the relationship depends on anatomic site. To address this, on-axis elastic moduli and apparent densities were measured for 142 specimens of human trabecular bone from the vertebra (n=61), proximal tibia (n=31), femoral greater trochanter (n=23), and femoral neck (n=27). Specimens were obtained from 61 cadavers (meanÂ±SD AGE=67Â±15 years). Experimental protocols were used that minimized end-artifact errors and controlled for specimen orientation. Tissue moduli were computed for a subset of 18 specimens using high-resolution linear finite element analyses and also using two previously developed theoretical relationships (Bone 25 (1999) 481; J. Elasticity 53 (1999) 125). Resultant power law regressions between modulus and density did depend on anatomic site, as determined via an analysis of covariance. The inter-site differences were among the leading coefficients (p{\textless}0.02), but not the exponents (p{\textgreater}0.08), which ranged 1.49â€“2.18. At a given density, specimens from the tibia had higher moduli than those from the vertebra (p=0.01) and femoral neck (p=0.002); those from the trochanter had higher moduli than the vertebra (p=0.02). These differences could be as large as almost 50\%, and errors in predicted values of modulus increased by up to 65\% when site-dependence was ignored. These results indicate that there is no universal modulusâ€“density relationship for on-axis loading. Tissue moduli computed using methods that account for inter-site architectural variations did not differ across site (p{\textgreater}0.15), suggesting that the site-specificity in apparent modulusâ€“density relationships may be attributed to differences in architecture.},

To investigate the hypothesis that the yield strains of human trabecular bone depend on anatomic site, the uniaxial tensile and compressive yield properties were compared for cylindrical specimens from the vertebra (n=61), proximal tibia (n=31), femoral greater trochanter (n=23), and femoral neck (n=27) taken from 61 donors (67+/-15years). Test protocols were used that minimized end artifacts and loaded specimens along the main trabecular orientation. Yield strains by site (mean+/-S.D.) ranged from 0.70+/-0.05\% for the trochanter to 0.85+/-0.10\% for the femoral neck in compression, from 0.61+/-0.05\% for the trochanter to 0.70+/-0.05\% for the vertebra in tension, and were always higher in compression than tension (p{\textless}0.001). The compressive yield strain was higher for the femoral neck than for all other sites (p{\textless}0.001), as was the tensile yield strain for the vertebra (p{\textless}0.007). Analysis of covariance, with apparent density as the covariate, indicated that inter-site differences existed in yield stress even after adjusting statistically for density (p{\textless}0.035). Coefficients of variation in yield strain within each site ranged from only 5-12\%, consistent with the strong linear correlations (r(2)=0.94-0.98) found between yield stress and modulus. These results establish that the yield strains of human trabecular bone can differ across sites, but that yield strain may be considered uniform within a given site despite substantial variation in elastic modulus and yield stress.},

No modulus reductions greater than 5\% were observed following overload magnitudes less than 0.73\% strain. For each specimen, changes in strength and Poisson's ratio were greater (p=0.02) than that in modulus by 10.8- and 26.6-fold, respectively, indicating that, for the specimen configuration used in this study, longitudinal elastic modulus is one of the least sensitive properties to a compressive overload. Residual strains were also proportionately greater by 6.4-fold (p=0.01) in the transverse than axial direction. These results suggest that efforts to relate microcrack density and morphology to changes in compressive mechanical properties of cortical bone may benefit from considering alternative parameters to modulus reductions.},

All these factors change with age as a result of the two dynamic processes: remodelling and modelling. When the changes become pronounced, osteoporotic fractures occur. There is a different aging pattern for men and women: 1. Men achieve a higher peak bone mass than women (mainly because of a larger cross-sectional area of their bones); 2. Men have no accelerated bone loss in middle age; and 3. Men seem to be able to compensate for their loss of cancellous bone strength by increasing their vertebral cross-sectional area with age. The general pattern, for both men and women is, though, that of an extreme (70-80\%) decline in whole vertebral body strength during normal aging. The accompanying decline in bone density is much less pronounced (35-45\%). This clearly illustrates the power relationship between bone density and strength.

	abstract = {Cylindrical trabecular bone samples from the central part of the first lumbar vertebral body were obtained from 42 normal people (27 females and 15 males) aged 15-87 years and analyzed by a compression test in either vertical or horizontal direction. Maximum stress, maximum stiffness, energy absorption capacity, and strain at maximum stress (compressibility) were calculated from the load-deformation curves. The ash density of the samples was measured after incineration. From age 20 to 80 years, the decline (P less than 0.01) in ash density was 48-50\% compared to a 75-80\% decrease (P less than 0.001) in vertical stress, stiffness, and energy absorption capacity. Qualitatively similar age-related changes (P less than 0.01) were observed by horizontal compression, but the absolute values were smaller. In both directions, highly significant positive correlations (P less than 0.01) were observed between the biomechanical properties and ash density stress, stiffness and energy absorption capacity still showed significant decreases with age (P less than 0.01). The vertical maximum strain values, which increased (P less than 0.05) with age, were inversely related to the other biomechanical variables (P less than 0.05) and to the ash density (P less than 0.05). It is concluded from the study that the biomechanical competence of vertebral trabecular bone depends not only on bone mass (ash density) but also on the continuity of the trabecular lattice, which changes with increasing age.},

	abstract = {The mechanical properties of cancellous bone have been shown to depend on bone density and on the anisotropy of the trabecular bone structure. By means of high-resolution quantitative computed tomography (QCT), providing a nominal resolution of 0.17 mm, it became possible to assess both apparent density and trabecular microstructure of intact bones. In order to study the influence of age- and disease-related bone loss on the mechanical properties of cancellous bone, a more phenomenological approach was used to develop a novel bone resorption algorithm, called simulated bone atrophy. The algorithm, which is principally based on constrained Gauss filtration of segmented data volumes, was applied to create derived microstructural models. The mechanical behavior of the cancellous bone can be expressed as a function of the anisotropic bone properties of the microstructural model on the continuum level. To study the influence of bone atrophy on bone strength we compared three models: the originally noninvasively measured bone biopsy and two derived models simulating moderate and pronounced atrophy. For the comparison of the three models, the apparent Young's moduli in the three orthogonal directions were predicted for each model with the help of three-dimensional finite-element analysis. Realistic results for the apparent Young's moduli were found for the tissue moduli chosen. The results suggest that the prediction of anisotropic material properties of cancellous bone based on noninvasive measurements of trabecular microstructures and the application of simulated bone atrophy may be helpful to understand the influence of age- and disease-related bone loss on bone strength.},

	abstract = {Macroporous scaffolds composed of biodegradable polymers have found extensive use as three-dimensional substrates either for in vitro cell seeding followed by transplantation, or as conductive substrates for direct implantation in vivo. Methods abound for creation of macroporous scaffolds for tissue engineering, and common methods typically employ a solid porogen within a three-dimensional polymer matrix to create a well-defined pore size, pore structure, and total scaffold porosity. This study describes an approach to impart improved pore interconnectivity to polymer scaffolds for tissue engineering by partially fusing the solid porogen together prior to creation of a continuous polymer matrix. Three dimensional, porous scaffolds of the copolymer 85:15 poly(lactide-co-glycolide) were fabricated via either a solvent casting/particulate leaching process, or a gas foaming/particulate leaching process. Prior to creation of a continuous polymer matrix the NaCl crystals, which serve as the solid porogen, are partially fused via treatment in 95\% humidity. Scanning electron micrographs clearly display fused salt crystals and an enhancement in pore interconnectivity in the salt fused scaffolds prepared via both solvent casting and gas foaming, and the extent of pore interconnectivity is enhanced with longer treatment times. Fusion of salt crystal for 24 h increased the radius of curvature of salt crystals, and led to a twofold increase in the compressive modulus of solvent cast scaffolds (total porosity of 97 +/- 1\%). Fusion of NaCl crystals prior to gas foaming resulted in a decrease in scaffold compressive modulus from 277 +/- 60k Pa to 187 +/- 30k Pa (total porosity of 94 +/- 1\%). The resulting highly interconnected scaffolds have implications for facilitated cell migration, abundant cell-cell interaction, and potentially improved neural and vascular growth within tissue engineering scaffolds.},

The Knee Society pain score improved from a preoperative value of 38 points (range, 4-80 points) to 83 points (range, 33-100 points) at last evaluation. The Knee Society function score improved from a preoperative value of 46 points (range, 5-100 points) to 64 points (range, 0-100 points) at last evaluation. Initial postoperative radiographs showed tibial bone-cement radiolucencies in 5 knees, but at final followup none of these radiolucencies had progressed. Radiolucencies developed in 5 additional tibial components by the time of final followup, but these were all incomplete and {\textless} 1 mm in width. Two femoral components had initial postoperative radiolucencies. These radiolucencies remained stable in 1 knee, whereas the other knee had asymptomatic radiographic loosening. Incomplete radiolucencies of {\textless} 1 mm developed in 3 additional femoral components at final followup. The incidence of tibial radiolucencies of 32\% in the present study is similar to the incidence of radiolucencies with a nonstemmed revision cemented total knee arthroplasty, with the same prosthetic design, previously reported from the authors' institution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {The balance between local remodeling and accumulation of trabecular bone microdamage is believed to play an important role in the maintenance of skeletal integrity. However, the local mechanical parameters associated with microdamage initiation are not well understood. Using histological damage labeling, micro-CT imaging, and image-based finite element analysis, regions of trabecular bone microdamage were detected and registered to estimated microstructural von Mises effective stresses and strains, maximum principal stresses and strains, and strain energy density (SED). Bovine tibial trabecular bone cores underwent a stepwise uniaxial compression routine in which specimens were micro-CT imaged following each compression step. The results indicate that the mode of trabecular failure observed by micro-CT imaging agreed well with the polarity and distribution of stresses within an individual trabecula. Analysis of on-axis subsections within specimens provided significant positive relationships between microdamage and each estimated tissue stress, strain and SED parameter. In a more localized analysis, individual microdamaged and undamaged trabeculae were extracted from specimens loaded within the elastic region and to the apparent yield point. As expected, damaged trabeculae in both groups possessed significantly higher local stresses and strains than undamaged trabeculae. The results also indicated that microdamage initiation occurred prior to apparent yield at local principal stresses in the range of 88-121 MPa for compression and 35-43 MPa for tension and local principal strains of 0.46-0.63\% in compression and 0.18-0.24\% in tension. These data provide an important step towards understanding factors contributing to microdamage initiation and establishing local failure criteria for normal and diseased trabecular bone.},

	abstract = {There is a lack of fundamental information on the knee biomechanics in deep flexion beyond 90 degrees. In this study, mechanical loads during activities requiring deep flexion were quantified on normal knees from 19 subjects, and compared with those in walking and stair climbing. The deep flexion activities generate larger net quadriceps moments (6.9-13.5\% body weight into height) and net posterior forces (58.3-67.8\% body weight) than routine ambulatory activities. Moreover, the peak net moments and the net posterior forces were generated between 90 degrees and 150 degrees of flexion. The large moments and forces will result in high stress at high angles of flexion. These loads can influence pathological changes to the joint and are important considerations for reconstructive procedures of the knee. The posterior cruciate ligament should have a substantial role during deep flexion, since there was a large posterior load that must be sustained at the knee. The mechanics of the knee in deep flexion are likely a factor causing problems of posterior instability in current total knee arthroplasty. Thus, it is important to consider the magnitude of the loads at the knee in the treatment of patients that commonly perform deep flexion during activities of daily living.},

It features largely automated coil inhomogeneity correction, trabecular bone region segmentation, serial image registration, bone/marrow binarization, and structural calculation steps. The system addresses problems of efficiency and inter- and intraoperator variability inherent in previous analyses. The system is evaluated on repetitive scans of 8 volunteers for both two-dimensional (2D) apparent structure calculations and three-dimensional (3D) mechanical calculations using micro-finite element analysis. Coil correction methods based on a priori knowledge of the coil sensitivity and on low-pass filtering of the high-resolution mages are compared and found to perform similarly. Image alignment is found to cause small but significant changes in some structural parameters. Overall the automated system provides on the order of a 3-fold decrease in trained operator time over previous manual methods. Reproducibility is found to be dependent on image quality for most parameters. For 7 subjects with good image quality, reproducibility of 2-4\% is found for 2D structural parameters, while 3D mechanical parameters vary by 4-9\%, with percent standardized coefficients of variation in the ranges of 15-34\% and 20-38\% respectively.},

In addition, the material Young's modulus (i.e. of the trabeculae themselves) was estimated using an ultrasonic technique. Apparent and true density were determined by direct physical measurements. Significant mechanical anisotropy was observed: mean structural Young's modulus varied from 165 MPa in the supero-inferior direction to 43 MPa in the lateral direction. Structural Young's modulus correlated with apparent density, with power-law regression models giving the best correlations (r2 = 0.52-0.88). Mechanical anisotropy increased as a function of decreasing apparent density (p {\textless} 0.001). Material Young's modulus was 10.0 +/- 1.3 GPa, and was negatively correlated with apparent density (p {\textless} 0.001). In multiple regression models, material Young's modulus was a significant independent predictor of structural Young's modulus only in the supero-inferior direction. The data suggest the presence of two effects in vertebral bone associated with decreasing apparent density and, by implication, bone loss in general: (a) increased mechanical anisotropy, such that there is relative conservation of stiffness in the axial direction compared with the transverse directions; and (b) increased stiffness of the trabeculae themselves.},

	abstract = {Multiaxial failure properties of trabecular bone are important for modeling of whole bone fracture and can provide insight into structure-function relationships. There is currently no consensus on the most appropriate form of multiaxial yield criterion for trabecular bone. Using experimentally validated, high-resolution, non-linear finite element models, biaxial plain strain boundary conditions were applied to seven bovine tibial specimens. The dependence of multiaxial yield properties on volume fraction was investigated to quantify the interspecimen heterogeneity in yield stresses and strains. Two specimens were further analyzed to determine the yield properties for a wide range of biaxial strain loading conditions. The locations and quantities of tissue level yielding were compared for on-axis, transverse, and biaxial apparent level yielding to elucidate the micromechanical failure mechanisms. As reported for uniaxial loading of trabecular bone, the yield strains in multiaxial loading did not depend on volume fraction, whereas the yield stresses did. Micromechanical analysis indicated that the failure mechanisms in the on-axis and transverse loading directions were mostly independent. Consistent with this, the biaxial yield properties were best described by independent curves for on-axis and transverse loading. These findings establish that the multiaxial failure of trabecular bone is predominantly governed by the strain along the loading direction, requiring separate analytical expressions for each orthotropic axis to capture the apparent level yield behavior.},

All patients received a TiAlV femoral component with a commercially pure titanium fiber-mesh undersurface. Cemented or cementless fixation was used based on a randomization protocol. Micromotions of the femoral components were recorded with roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis during the first 2 postoperative years. The magnitude of migration did not differ between cemented and uncemented fixation. The number of nonmigrating prostheses decreased from 21 (12 cemented and nine uncemented) at 3 months to six (three cemented and three uncemented) at 24 months. In both groups, the magnitude of prosthetic tilting about the longitudinal axis (internal-external rotation) was as large as that about the transverse axis (flexion-extension). Rotation into extension was as common as rotation into flexion. The largest translations were recorded at either of the posterior condyles. In 10 uncemented components, radiolucent lines were seen at the distal interface postoperatively. Proximal migration of the femoral component was recorded in these knees, and the width of the lines decreased or the lines disappeared totally at 24 months. After 2 years, lines were noted around four cemented and four uncemented replacements, mainly anteriorly or distally. All of these prostheses migrated. One prosthesis, revised because of malalignment, displayed pronounced migration after an initial period of stability.

	volume = {35},
	abstract = {Bisphosphonates increase bone mass and reduce fracture risk, but their anti-resorptive action may lead to increases in fatigue microdamage. To investigate how bisphosphonate effects influence changes in bone volume and microdamage in the long term, a strain-adaptive model of bone remodeling and microdamage balance was developed for a continuum-level volume of postmenopausal trabecular bone by invoking Frost's mechanostat hypothesis. Both disuse and fatigue microdamage were assumed to stimulate the activation frequency of basic multicellular units (BMUs) such that bone remodeling served to remove excess bone mass and microdamage. Bisphosphonate effects were simulated as follows: low, intermediate, high, or complete suppression of BMU activation frequency either without a change in resorption by the BMU or with an independent decrease in resorption while the bone formation process was unaffected (i.e., formation initially exceeded resorption). Of the bisphosphonate effects, a reduction in resorption relative to formation dictated the long-term gain in bone volume while the potency of activation frequency suppression controlled the rate of gain. A plateau in the bone mass gain that typically occurs in clinical studies of bisphosphonate treatment was predicted by the model because the resultant reduction in strain forced bone formation by the BMU to decrease over time until it matched the reduction in BMU resorption. A greater suppression of activation frequency proportionally increased microdamage, but the accumulation was limited over the long term as long as remodeling was incompletely suppressed. The results of the model suggest creating bisphosphonates that provide minimal suppression of remodeling and a large decrease in BMU resorption because this would minimize damage accumulation and increase bone mass, respectively.},

	abstract = {Cancellous bone architecture and mechanics are intimately related. The trabecular architecture of cancellous bone is considered determined by its mechanical environment (Wolff's law), and the mechanical properties of cancellous bone are inversely determined by the trabecular architecture and material properties. Much effort has been spent in expressing these relations, but the techniques and variables necessary for this have not been fully identified. It is obvious, however, that some measure of architectural anisotropy (fabric) is needed. Within the last few years, volume-based measures of fabric have been introduced as alternatives to the mean intercept length method, which has some theoretical problems. This paper seeks to answer which of four different fabric measures best predicts finite element calculated mechanical anisotropy directions. Twenty-nine cancellous bone specimens were three-dimensionally reconstructed using the automated serial sectioning technique. A series of large-scale finite-element analyses were performed on each of the three-dimensional reconstructions to calculate the compliance matrix for each specimen, from which the mechanical principal directions were derived. The architectural anisotropy was determined in three-dimensional space for each specimen using mean intercept length (MIL), volume orientation (VO), star volume distribution (SVD) and star length distribution (SLD). Each of the architectural anisotropy results were expressed by a fabric tensor. Architectural main directions were determined from the fabric tensors and compared with the FE-calculated mechanical anisotropy directions. All architectural measures predicted the mechanical main directions rather well, which supports the assumption that mechanical anisotropy directions are aligned with fabric directions. MIL showed a significant, though very small (1.4 degrees), deviation from the primary mechanical direction. VO had difficulty in determining secondary and tertiary mechanical directions; its mean deviation was 8.9 degrees. SVD and SLD provided marginally better predictors of mechanical anisotropy directions than MIL and VO.},

We used two cadaveric models of hip arthroplasty, one human and one canine, to evaluate the accuracy and precision of RSA-based estimates of translations of the femoral component with respect to the femur under ideal conditions. The femoral components were attached rigidly to a micrometer stage that provided standard displacements in increments of 25 and 50 microm in the interval from zero to 500 microm along three orthogonal axes. Radiostereometric examinations were performed for each increment. Accuracy was calculated as the 95\% prediction intervals from regression analyses between the measured and actual displacements. Precision was evaluated as the standard deviation of five repeated measurements of a 200 microm displacement along each axis. Both accuracy and precision were best along the longitudinal axis, with a prediction interval of +/-47 microm in the human model and +/-45 microm in the canine model and a standard deviation of 30 microm in the human model and 40 microm in the canine model. The use of only the prosthetic head as a landmark (as opposed to three markers placed on the femoral stem) led to a 3-fold larger prediction interval in the human model and a 2-fold greater prediction interval in the canine model.},

	abstract = {In this study, a finite element model of a vertebral body was used to study the load-bearing role of the two components (shell and core) under compression. The model of the vertebral body has the characteristic kidney shape transverse cross section with concave lateral surfaces and flat superior and inferior surfaces. A nonlinear unit cell based foam model was used for the trabecular core, where nonlinearity was introduced as coupled elastoplastic beam behavior of individual trabeculae. The advantage of the foam model is that architecture and material properties are separated, thus facilitating studies of the effects of architecture on the apparent behavior. Age-related changes in the trabecular architecture were considered in order to address the effects of osteoporosis on the load-sharing behavior. Stiffness changes with age (architecture and porosity changes) for the trabecular bone model were shown to follow trends in published experimental results. Elastic analyses showed that the relative contribution of the shell to the load-bearing ability of the vertebra decreases with increasing age and lateral wall curvature. Elasto-plastic (non-linear) analyses showed that failure regions were concentrated in the upper posterior region of the vertebra in both the shell and core components. The ultimate load of the vertebral body model varied from 2800 N to 5600 N, depending on age (architecture and porosity of the trabecular core) and shell thickness. The model predictions lie within the range of experimental results. The results provide an understanding of the relative role of the core and shell in vertebral body mechanics and shed light on the yield and post-yield behavior of the vertebral body.},

	abstract = {Alterations in strain patterns in both the femur and acetabulum of the dog, due to cementless total hip arthroplasty (THA), were evaluated by monitoring cortical bone strains before and immediately following implantation of components, using an accurate in vitro jig, simulating the loading of the canine hip in vivo. Femoral arthroplasty with straight stem, canal-filling, femoral components, made of titanium-based alloy, led to a statistically significant reduction of proximal femoral bone strains, with proximal medical compressive strains reduced, on average, to only 22\% of intact strain magnitude (p less than 0.01), even though the prostheses contained collars and were not fixed with cement. Strain alterations on the acetabulum, following cementless THA, were more complex and variable. Laterally, a significant decrease (p less than 0.01) in periacetabular strains to between 20 and 60\% of the intact state was observed, while medial wall strains varied inconsistently after arthroplasty. These strain alterations reflect major changes in mechanical loading of both the femur and acetabulum immediately following cementless THA, using components similar to those used clinically in humans. Major reductions in strains on the proximal femur occurred with cementless femoral components, while the change in strains on the acetabulum were variable, and could be a result of variations in fit and placement of components inherent even in well-controlled implantation techniques. The physiologic in vitro loading of the canine femur with the pelvis, used to obtain these data, can be applied to future investigations exploring stress transfer around uncemented components and the relationship of stress transfer to morphological changes of bone, in the canine model.},

	abstract = {There is strong evidence to suggest that inducible displacements, migration and implant loosening are closely related to the initial mechanical environment of the implanted tibia. If this is true, then it should be possible to predict the likelihood of implant migration using patient-specific finite element models. Finite element models of the proximal implanted tibiae were analysed based on pre-operative quantitative computed tomography data of four patients entered into a radiographic migration study. These four patients were also part of an radiostereometric analysis (RSA) study. A variety of load cases were analysed and the risk of bone failure determined for a 2 mm layer of bone immediately beneath the tibial tray. The results were compared with the RSA data measured 1 year post-operatively for each patient. For each patient, an appropriate load case was selected based on patient weight and on the varus-valgus migrations observed in the migration study. The two patients with press-fit implants were predicted to have the highest risk of failure and were found to migrate the most. The two patients with bonded implants (one HA coated and one cemented) were found to have a low risk of failure and these implants migrated the least. This study suggests that the degree of implant migration is dependent on the initial mechanical environment and can be determined using patient-specific finite element analysis.},

A transverse mid-diaphyseal fracture of the right radius was surgically induced and was stabilized by external coaptation splinting. Fracture healing and bone remodeling were evaluated by radiography, gross and histological examination, and bone histomorphometry. The mechanical properties of the fracture callus were determined by a four-point bending test. Radiographs and gross and microscopic examination demonstrated normal bone healing at the fracture site in all dogs. In dogs that received alendronate during the fracture healing period, at 16 weeks the calluses were approximately 2-3 times larger than those in dogs that received a placebo during the healing period. This is consistent with slower callus bone remodeling, an expected pharmacological effect of the compound. Bone histomorphometry demonstrated that treatment with alendronate did not inhibit bone formation or mineralization. Mechanical testing showed that the ultimate load at failure and the flexural rigidity of both the fractured and contralateral intact bone were unaffected by treatment with alendronate. Therefore, in this study, treatment with alendronate before or during fracture healing, or both, resulted in no adverse effects on the union, strength, or mineralization of bone in mature beagle dogs.},

Proponents of full cementation of the tibial stem and component state that better short-term and long-term component fixation is achieved when full cementation is used. Advocates for surface cementation contend that sufficient implant stability is achieved without the increased bone loss that occurs at revision and the stress shielding thought to be linked with cemented stems. This biomechanical cadaver study compared initial fixation and cement penetration depth in fully cemented versus surface cemented tibial trays with two different stem geometries (cruciate and I-beam) and compared two stem designs (cruciate and I-beam) fixed with surface cementation. Under an eccentric load, simulating three times body weight for 6000 cycles, there seems to be no difference in the micromotion of either tibial component implanted with surface or full cementation. Additionally, no difference in the average depth of cement penetration was detected between fixation techniques or stem types. The initial fixation stability of the surface cement technique seems correlated to the depth of cement penetration into proximal tibial surface. The current data support other studies which indicate that stability of surface-cemented tibial components may be related to the depth of cement penetration.},

The other 11 patients (n 11) formed a consecutive series with the Duracon femoral component. In the trabecular bone above the femoral component, bone mineral density (BMD) was measured in 2 regions of interest (ROI) anteriorly to the fixation pegs (ROI 1) and above the pegs (ROI 2), using dual photon absorptiometry (DPA). There were no differences between the Modular component and the modified version regarding the postoperative decrease in BMD. There was a decrease in BMD in both ROI 1 and ROI 2 with all 3 different femoral components, and in both ROIs the highest bone loss rate was observed during the first 3 months after surgery. On average (n 29), a significant bone loss of 44\% and 19\% in ROI 1 and ROI 2, respectively, was reached at the 1-year follow-up, compared to the initial values. A decrease of this magnitude in BMD in the anterior distal femur 1 year after TKA may be an important determinant of periprosthetic fracture and later failure of the femoral component. In this experimental set-up, a modified femoral component with an altered location of the porous coating did not influence the development of bone loss.},

Using either conventional X-ray sources or synchrotron sources currently allows the acquisition of 3D images in a wide range of spatial resolution that may be as small as a few micrometers. Since it is technically possible to examine trabecular architecture at different scales, a question is to know what type of information it is possible to get at each scale. For this purpose, a series of ten vertebrae samples from healthy females of different ages (33 to 90) was imaged at various resolutions on three different micro-CT systems (cubic voxel size respectively 14, 6.7 and 1.4 microm). The comparison of morphometric parameters extracted from the different images is in agreement with simulation results on the influence of spatial resolution on structure parameters. The conclusion is that a 14 microm voxel size gives a reasonably good parameterisation of trabecular architecture. Besides the synchrotron radiation 2 microm level images reveal interesting features on the irregularities and rupture of trabecular surface, and on remodeling zones.},

Sintered porous- and plasma spray-coated implants represent the most common cementless orthopedic implants in current clinical use, although novel cast structures also are being investigated. All stand to benefit from surface modifications currently being explored to enhance osteoconductive or osteoinductive characteristics of the implants.

Ten-node quadratic tetrahedra (T10) having parabolic displacement functions were compared with four-node linear tetrahedron elements (T4) on the basis of accuracy and central processing unit (CPU) time. From the analyses of 11 finite element meshes, it was concluded that linear tetrahedral elements should be avoided and quadratic tetrahedral elements ought to be chosen for the purposes of finite element analysis of the human femur.

A mechanistic model has been formulated to predict bone adaptation based on the concept that the continuous processes of damage and repair regulate bone adaptation. We apply the model to investigate the significance of two features of intramedullary prosthesis design on bone adaptation: prosthesis Young's modulus and the presence of a prosthesis collar. Results, as well, as indicating some characteristics of accumulative-damage stimulated bone adaptation, predict that a low Young's modules stem will very much reduce the extent of bone loss whereas the presence of a collar will have no significant effect.

	abstract = {The adaptation of bones to a change in function has been recognised for many centuries, but only recently have mathematical laws been proposed to describe it. One proposed mathematical law is based on the hypothesis that, after a change in load, the strain in the bone microstructure is regulated to a homeostatic equilibrium. Strain-adaptive remodelling has been used successfully to simulate bone adaptation around orthopaedic implants but the predictive capabilities are constrained because many empirical constants are required in the remodelling law (a reference stimulus, a zone of equilibrium stresses or 'lazy zone' and a parameter transducing macroscopic stresses to a tissue level stimulus). An alternative approach has been proposed. It is that bone adapts to attain an optimal strength by regulating the damage generated in its microstructural elements. The question is raised whether or not a mathematical law to predict the time course of bone adaptation can be derived for damage-adaptive remodelling in a similar way to the mathematical laws based on a strain stimulus. In the present study, the hypotheses required to develop damage-adaptive remodelling laws are proposed and a remodelling law to predict the time course of bone adaptation is derived. It is shown that this is an integral remodelling law which accounts naturally for the stress history to which the tissue has been exposed since formation. A simulation of the adaptive response of a bone diaphysis under a change in torsional load shows that the law gives physically reasonable predictions. The initial remodelling prediction is similar to strain-adaptive remodelling. However, in the later stages of remodelling, the predictions differ from strain-adaptive remodelling in that direct convergence to a homeostatic strain is not predicted. Instead, undershoot (in the case of a reduction in load) and overshoot (in the case of an increase in load) are predicted.},

	abstract = {Measurement of the width of thin structures such as the cortical shell of the vertebral body or femoral neck with computed tomography (CT) is limited by the spatial resolution of the CT system. Limited spatial resolution exists both within the CT image plane and perpendicular to it and can be described by the in-plane point spread function (PSF) and the across-plane slice sensitivity profile (SSP), respectively. The goal of this study was to confirm that errors of thickness measurement of thin structures critically depend on the spatial positioning of the object and the spatial resolution limitations of CT in all three dimensions, and to assess the size of the errors themselves. We compared computer models that incorporated both effects to experimentally assessed cortical thicknesses of the European Spine Phantom. Analysis included varying CT slice width, the orientation of measurement and angle beta of misalignment of longitudinal scanner and phantom axes. Agreement of models with measurements was good in all configurations with an overall error of 0.17 mm. This showed that PSF and SSP are adequate system characteristics to predict deviation of measured values from true widths. Errors between measurements and true cortical thickness values delta(true) averaged to 1.5 mm were strongly positively correlated with slice width d and beta. When the across-plane partial volume effect was eliminated, limited in-plane resolution still accounted for overestimation of delta(true) by 0.68 (137\%), 0.27 (27\%), and 0.06 mm (4\%) for delta(true)=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mm, respectively. For delta(true) of 1.0 mm and above, it was shown that although the absolute cortical thickness values might not be accurately measurable, relative differences between two values are reflected in measurement. Implications for cortical thickness measurement are that the spinal cortical shell is too thin, whereas accurate assessment at locations of the femoral neck exhibiting a thicker cortical shell of both difference and absolute values should be possible with CT even for larger misalignment angles, especially when a smaller CT slice width is chosen.},

This study tests the following hypothesis: nonlinear viscoelasticity of ligament requires a description more general than the separable quasilinear viscoelasticity (QLV) formulation commonly used. The experimental test for this hypothesis involves performing both creep and relaxation studies at various loads and deformations below the damage threshold. Freshly harvested, rat medial collateral ligaments (MCLs) were used as a model. Results consistently show a nonlinear behavior in which the rate of creep is dependent upon stress level and the rate of relaxation is dependent upon strain level. Furthermore, relaxation proceeds faster than creep; consistent with the experimental observations of Thornton et al. (25) The above results from rat MCLs are not consistent with a separable QLV theory. Inclusion of these nonlinearities would require a more general formulation.},

This nonlinear behavior requires a more general description than the separable quasilinear viscoelasticity theory commonly used in tissue biomechanics. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the nonlinear theory of Schapery or the modified superposition method could adequately model the strain-dependent stress-relaxation behavior of ligaments. It is shown herein that both theories describe available nonlinear experimental ligament data well and hence can account for both elastic and viscous nonlinearities. However, modified superposition allows for a more direct interpretation of the relationship between model parameters and physical behavior, such as elastic and viscous nonlinearities, than does Schapery's theory. Hence, the modified superposition model is suggested to describe ligament data demonstrating both elastic nonlinearity and strain-dependent relaxation rate behavior. The behavior of the modified superposition model under a sinusoidal strain history is also examined. The model predicts that both elastic and viscous behaviors are dependent on strain amplitude and frequency.},

After aggressive fatigue loading of stem/cement/femur constructs, micro-cracks and stem/bone micro-motions were quantified to answer three research questions: Are cracks preferentially associated with the stem/cement interface, the cement/bone interface or voids? Is cement damage dependent on axial position? Does cement damage correlate with micro-motion between the stem and the bone? Eight Charnley Cobra stems were implanted in cadaveric femora. Six stem/cement/femur constructs were subjected to "stair-climbing" loads for 300 kcycles at 2Hz. Loads were normalized by construct stiffness to avoid fracture. Two additional constructs were not loaded. Transverse sections were cut at 10mm intervals, stained with a fluorescent dye penetrant and examined using epi-fluorescence stereomicroscopy. Crack lengths and cement areas were recorded for 9 sections per specimen. Crack length-density was calculated by dividing summed crack length by cement mantle area. To isolate the effect of loading, length-density data were offset by the baseline length-density measured in the non-loaded specimens. Significantly more cracks were associated with the interdigitated area (35.1\%+/-11.6\%) and the cement/bone interface (31.0\%+/-6.2\%) than with the stem/cement interface (11.0\%+/-5.2\%) or voids (6.1\%+/-4.8\%) (p{\textless}0.05). Load-induced micro-crack length-density was significantly dependent on axial position, increasing proximally (p{\textless}0.001). Micro-motions were small, all stems rotated internally.

The bone-cement and bone-prosthesis interfaces were both assumed to be discontinuous. A dry friction model based on Coulomb's criterion was adopted for the interfaces friction. The model was shown to be able to give compressive and shear stresses distributions and distractive and relative shear micromotions at these interfaces. A preliminary application was conducted for cemented metal tray total condylar (MTTC) and for cemented and uncemented porous coated anatomic (PCA) tibial plateaus. The PCA plateaus were found to be more deformable and had greater global displacements than the MTTC one. Debonding of the bone-peg interface was observed for the uncemented PCA. Correspondingly, the stress peaks at the interface beneath the tray were lower for the uncemented PCA. Correspondingly, the stress peaks at the interface beneath the tray were lower for the PCA than for the MTTC. Shear micromotions appeared under the tray for both the two prostheses.

	title = {Factors influencing stability at the interface between a porous surface and cancellous bone: a finite element analysis of a canine in vivo micromotion experiment},
	volume = {36},
	abstract = {Several factors contribute to the success of stable bony ingrowth into the porous coated surfaces of orthopaedic implants used in hip arthroplasty. Despite having good bony apposition, bony ingrowth might not occur if the relative motion between bone and implant is large. Therefore, determining the limiting micromotion value that inhibits stable bony ingrowth is important. From a previous canine in vivo micromotion study performed at our laboratory, this limiting value was found to be 20 microns. Initially, cementless orthopaedic implants are stabilized only by frictional forces at the bone-implant interface. Therefore, other parameters such as the coefficient of friction and the compressive force normal to the interface should be considered as important factors which stabilize the interface along with micromotion. The purpose of this analytical study was to elucidate how the stability at the bone-implant interface is influenced by various factors, namely, motion of the implant, the coefficient of friction, the degree of pres fit, and the modulus of the surrounding cancellous bone in determining the stability of the bone-implant interface. Nonlinear and linear finite element models which simulated the immediate postsurgical condition and the end point of the canine in vivo micromotion experiment, respectively, were used to this end. From the results of the finite element models it was possible to identify the displacement magnitude for which the implant slipped relative to the bone as the motion of the implant was increased incrementally. This was done for combinations of the coefficient of friction, press fit, and Young's modulus of cancellous bone. This was used as an indicator of the limiting implant motion value beyond which bony ingrowth will be inhibited. The stress distribution in the surrounding cancellous bone bed was also obtained from the results of the finite element analyses for different press-fit conditions. The results of the study indicated that under slight press-fit conditions, the implant slipped relative to bone for implant motions as low as 20 microns. For higher degrees of press fit and reasonable values for the coefficient of friction, no slip occurred for implant motions as much as 100 microns. Although higher degrees of press fit were theoretically conducive to better implant stability, the concomitant high stresses in the adjacent cancellous bone will tend to compromise the integrity of the press fit. This was also evident when the results of an analytical model with a lower degree of press fit correlated well with those of the canine in vivo experiment in which a higher press fit was used, suggesting a possibility of achieving a less than desired press fit during the process of implantation. Through this study the importance of factors other than implant motion was emphasized. The results of the study suggest that the limiting value of implant motion that inhibits bone ingrowth might vary with the degree of press fit for reasonable coefficients of friction.},

Results show that the friction curve is highly nonlinear. Friction coefficients measured vary between 0.3 and 1.3. The friction coefficient of the interface is independent of the excision site of the bone cubes and of the magnitude of the rate of relative displacement at the interface. The friction coefficient appears to vary slightly with the normal contact pressure for all the metal surfaces. Both porous surfaces have statistically a higher friction coefficient than the smooth surface. This is likely due to the presence of surface asperities whereby the metal ploughs the bone surface. However, no significant differences is observed between bead and fiber mesh types.},

	abstract = {Dynamic patient-specific musculoskeletal models have great potential for addressing clinical problems in orthopedics and rehabilitation. However, their predictive capability is limited by how well the underlying kinematic model matches the patient's structure. This study presents a general two-level optimization procedure for tuning any multi-joint kinematic model to a patient's experimental movement data. An outer level optimization modifies the model's parameters (joint position and orientations) while repeated inner level optimizations modify the model's degrees of freedom given the current parameters, with the goal of minimizing errors between model and experimental marker trajectories. The approach is demonstrated by fitting a 27 parameter, three-dimensional, 12 degree-of-freedom lower-extremity kinematic model to synthetic and experimental movement data for isolated joint (hip, knee, and ankle) and gait (full leg) motions. For noiseless synthetic data, the approach successfully recovered the known joint parameters to within an arbitrarily tight tolerance. When noise was added to the synthetic data, root-mean-square (RMS) errors between known and recovered joint parameters were within 10.4 degrees and 10 mm. For experimental data, RMS marker distance errors were reduced by up to 62\% compared to methods that estimate joint parameters from anatomical landmarks. Optimized joint parameters found using a loaded full-leg gait motion differed significantly from those found using unloaded individual joint motions. In the future, this approach may facilitate the creation of dynamic patient-specific musculoskeletal models for predictive clinical applications.},

With either testing technique the mean trabecular Young's modulus was found to be significantly less than that of cortical bone (p {\textless} 0.0001). However, the specimens were dried before microtensile testing so Young's modulus values may have been greater than those of trabeculae in vivo. Using Young's modulus measurements obtained from 450 cubes of cancellous bone and 256 cubes of cortical bone, Wolff's hypothesis that cortical bone is simply dense cancellous bone was tested. A multiple regression analysis that controlled for group membership showed that Young's modulus of cortical bone cannot be extrapolated from the Young's modulus vs density relationship for cancellous bone, yet the Young's modulus of trabeculae can be predicted by extrapolation from the relationship between Young's modulus vs density of the cancellous bone. These results suggest that when considered mechanically, cortical and trabecular bone are not the same material.},

	issn = {0884-0431},
	abstract = {In an age- and sex-stratified population sample (n = 700), we estimated fall-related loads and bone strength indices at the UDR and FN. These load/strength ratios more closely simulated patterns of wrist and hip fractures occurring in the same population than did measurement of vBMD. INTRODUCTION: Areal BMD measurements, although associated with fracture risk, incompletely explain patterns of fragility fractures. Moreover, population-based assessments relating applied loads and whole bone strength to fracture patterns have not been made. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using QCT, we assessed volumetric BMD (vBMD), cross-sectional geometry, and axial (EA) and flexural (EI) rigidities (indices of bone's resistance to compressive and bending loads, respectively) at the ultradistal radius (UDR) and femoral neck (FN) and estimated the loads applied to the wrist and hip during a fall. We used fall load (FL)/bone strength ratios to estimate fracture risk. RESULTS: vBMD in young adults was similar between sexes. Decreases in vBMD over life were also similar (30\% and 28\%) at UDR but were somewhat greater (46\% and 34\%) at FN in women versus men, respectively. In young adults, FL/strength ratios at UDR were 32-51\% lower (better) in men than in women and increased (worsened) over life less in men (+4\% to +22\%) than in women (+20\% to +33\%). In young adults, FL/strength ratios at FN were only marginally better in men than in women but worsened less over life in men (+22\% to +36\%) than in women (+40\% to +62\%). CONCLUSIONS: The 6:1 female preponderance and the virtual immunity of men for age-related increases in wrist fractures are largely explained by the more favorable FL/strength ratios at UDR in young adult men (because of larger bone size and more favorable geometry) versus women and to maintaining this advantage over life. The 2-fold lower incidence of hip fractures in men versus women is largely explained by age-related increases (worsening) of FL/bone strength ratios that are only one-half of the increases in women. The moderate increases in these ratios with aging are insufficient to explain the {\textgreater}4-fold increase in hip fracture incidence after age 75 in both sexes, suggesting contributions of other factors, especially the well-documented increased frequency of injurious falls among the elderly.},

	abstract = {We are exploring methods of quantitating the 3D microstructure of bone in a way that will provide quantitative information about the functional status of the bone. The basic strategy is to image the spatial distribution of a selected, local, marker of function (e.g., material properties or new bone formation) and relate this to the simultaneously imaged 3D anatomic microstructure. Many of these approaches are extensions of well-established 2D imaging techniques (e.g., use of fluorophores and autoradiography) to 3D micro-CT. Local stresses throughout the microstructure can be estimated from the 3D geometry (and change in that geometry in response to stress applied to the outside of the bones) and correlated to the local function. In addition to study of bone, we are also exploring calcification of arterial walls, both within the bone and outside the bone, such as coronary arteries. Arterial calcification in ovariectomised rats has been observed.},

	abstract = {The Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register is dependent on the participating clinics regarding accuracy of information. As the register is prospective, and since revision is used as the endpoint in survival analyses, it is important that all revisions of registered primary arthroplasties are reported. To validate the register, we sent a questionnaire to all living patients with 30,796 knees registered as having been operated on from 1975-1995. Of living patients, 99\% could be located and 93\% answered. We found that one fifth of the revisions had not been reported and that relatively fewer revisions were lost to follow-up during the first decade of the register than in the following years. To investigate whether the Patient Administrative System (PAS), a database based on ICD coding and run by the Swedish health authorities, could be used to locate missing revisions found by the postal survey, we compared this database with the Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register. 84\% of the missing revisions revealed by the postal survey were found by using this method. Hence after the survey and the use of the PAS to find unreported revisions in deceased and non-responding patients, we estimate that 94\% of all revisions are accounted for. Apart from a generally higher cumulative revision rate, conclusions reported from the Register in recent years regarding survivorship seem to be unaffected by the underreporting.},

	abstract = {By combining data from the Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register and Swedish census registers we have calculated the past age-specific incidence of primary knee arthroplasties and predicted the demand. During the last 20 years, osteoarthrosis has accounted for the largest increase in number of knee arthroplasties while operations for rheumatoid arthritis remained constant. The mean yearly number of operations between the periods 1976-1980 and 1996-1997 increased more than five-fold, while only 6\% of that increase could be explained by changes in the age-profile of the population. Most operations were performed on persons of 65 years and older who also had the largest increase in incidence. By using the incidences for 1996 and 1997 and taking into account the expected future changes in the age profile of the Swedish population, we estimate that, in the absence of an effective preventive treatment, the number of knee arthroplasties will increase by at least one third until 2030.},

The 1970s were selected because most innovations occurred during those years. Two different design approaches were undertaken simultaneously. One was a functional approach whereas the other was a strictly anatomical approach. Initially, these 2 approaches led to very different designs. But the common goal of recreating human knee function eventually led to more similarities than differences. The author describes how, when, and why these dedicated individuals came to their ideas.

Crossed pinning provided greater fracture stability and a broader distribution of bone stresses than pinning through the radius styloid alone. Steel pins provided greater fracture stability; however, bioabsorbable pins produced lower stress concentration in the bone near the pins.

METHODS: Test-retest reliability, internal consistency, validity, and responsiveness was determined in 52 patients (mean age 48 (20-69)) with arthroscopically assessed cartilage damage of the tibio-femoral knee joint. RESULTS: All WOMAC scales were internally consistent with Cronbach's alpha coefficients of 0.83, 0.87, and 0.96 pre-operatively. Test-retest reliability was satisfactory with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.74, 0.58, and 0.92. As hypothesized worse post-operative but not pre-operative outcomes were associated with radiographic OA. In comparison with the SF-36 the expected correlations were found when comparing items measuring similar and dissimilar constructs, supporting the concepts of convergent and divergent construct validity. Three months after arthroscopy significant mean improvement was seen in all WOMAC scales (p{\textless}0.0004).

	abstract = {A numerical model of a femoral total hip component based on the finite element method is developed to evaluate the relative micromotions at the bone-implant interface and the stress distribution in the femoral bone. The interface is modelled as unilateral contact involving Coulomb's dry friction between the bone and the implant. In addition, the model includes inhomogeneity, anisotropy as well as plasticity of both cortical and spongious bones. An automatic data processor coupled to a three-dimensional mesh generator is designed to extract cortical bone geometry and inhomogeneous distribution of trabecular bone density from data obtained with quantitative computed tomography (QCT). A preliminary application is conducted to evaluate the mechanical behaviour of an existing bone-prosthesis structure for two typical loadings: a load simulating the single leg stance and a load simulating the stair climbing stance. The obtained results are subdivided in two parts. Firstly, the characterization of stress transfer and micromotions at the bone-stem interface. The peak value of the shear micromotions reaches 600 microns in the proximal medial region with a friction coefficient equal to 0.6. An analysis of the influence of the friction coefficient reveals that the shear and distractive micromotions as well as the shear and normal stresses depend strongly on this coefficient. Secondly, the representation of stresses in the femoral bone. Determination of complementary invariants such as the hydrostatic pressure, the deviatoric stress and anisotropic stresses brings additional insights in the evaluation of the stress field in the femoral bone.},

	abstract = {Changes with age in cross-sectional geometry of the lower limb bones were investigated in a large sample of cadaveric skeletal material from U.S. white adults. Section properties (areas and second moments of area) were determined at 11 locations by sectioning and direct measurement of 103 femora and 99 tibiae. All properties were standardized for body size differences by dividing by powers of bone length, and age trends were determined through linear regression analysis. Results indicate that while both men and women undergo endosteal resorption of bone and medullary expansion with aging, only men exhibit concurrent subperiosteal bone apposition and expansion. As a consequence, men show little change in cortical area and some increase in second moments of area with age, while women show decreases in both cortical area and second moments of area. Thus, only men appear to remodel bone in a way that would tend to compensate for loss of bone material strength with aging. In a previous study of a preindustrial sample with high activity levels, both men and women exhibited bone subperiosteal expansion and increase in second moments of area with aging. Together with observed differences in fracture incidence among living populations, these findings suggest that relatively low activity levels may not stimulate optimal bone remodeling throughout life and thus may contribute to higher risk of fracture in old age.},

	abstract = {The tibial components in 143 patients with total knee replacements performed before 1988 were assessed for micromotion using roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA) over a period of 13 years. The fixation of the prostheses remained clinically sound in all cases, although revision had been required for other reasons in seven. In a second group taken from all cases with RSA available on our full database to 1990, 15 tibial components had been followed by RSA from the insertion until, 1 to 11 years after the initial arthroplasty, they were revised for mechanical loosening of the tibial component; 12 of these comprised all the loosenings in the base group, thus making a total of 155 consecutive cases, while an additional three were inserted after the base material had been compiled. The mean migration in the first group was about 1 mm at one year, but subsequent migration was slower, reaching a mean of about 1.5 mm after ten years. About one-third migrated continuously throughout follow-up, while two-thirds ceased to migrate after one to two years. In the revision group, 14 components had migrated continuously and at one year significantly more than those in the first group. One revision case lacked the crucial one-year follow-up and could not be classified. These findings suggest that mechanical loosening begins early in the postoperative period. Clinical symptoms which necessitate revision, seen at this stage in 20\% of abnormally migrating tibial components, may not appear until up to ten years after the operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Valid outcome measurement tools are required to reliably demonstrate the effectiveness and clinical outcomes of lower-extremity arthroplasty. Having ascertained a lack of a practical and valid measure of the change in actual daily physical activity that occurs prior to and following lower-limb arthroplasty, we developed and validated a lower-extremity activity scale. METHODS: The eighteen-level self-administered scale was developed with the aid of content experts to ensure face validity. Validity and reliability were assessed with the use of (1) pedometer measurements of seventy subjects over seven days; (2) next-of-kin proxy measurements of the activity levels of ninety patients before they underwent lower-limb arthroplasty; and (3) application, and correlation with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores, in a prospective seventeen-center clinical study of 297 consecutive patients undergoing revision total knee arthroplasty. In this latter study, demographic and comorbidity data were also collected. Univariate and bivariate correlations were performed, and a multivariate structured equation modeling approach was used to further test responsiveness, reliability, and validity of the lower-extremity activity scale. RESULTS: Pedometer readings correlated with the activity levels derived with the lower-extremity activity scale (r = 0.79). Of note was the finding that age, weight, and body mass index did not correlate well with the average number of steps per day (r = -0.32, -0.32, and -0.25, respectively). A significant correlation was found between the lower-extremity activity scores recorded by the patients and those reported by their next of kin (Pearson correlation, r = 0.715; p = 0.0001) and between the initial lower-extremity activity scores and two-week-retest scores (intraclass correlation = 0.9147; p {\textless} 0.0001), demonstrating the validity and reliability of the scale. The lower-extremity activity scale was responsive, accurately reflecting changes in the patient's condition between baseline and the time of follow-up (p {\textless} 0.001), and it was reliable, with baseline values correlating with follow-up scores (p {\textless} 0.001). The convergent validity of the lower-extremity activity scale was established by correlations with the function scores (r = -0.301, p {\textless} 0.001) and pain scores (r = -0.241, p {\textless} 0.001) derived with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and with a higher number of comorbidities (r = -0.244, p {\textless} 0.001). Multivariate path modeling further demonstrated diminished activity in patients who had more difficulty in functioning and a greater number of comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a lower-extremity activity scale and validated that it was an effective instrument for the assessment of patients' actual activity levels. It is easy to apply and interpret, and it is valid and ready for use in the clinical setting. This scale will allow more accurate analysis and prediction of outcomes. Consequently, it will become a useful, practical adjunct to objective clinical decision-making and intervention for patients undergoing arthroplasty.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The perioperative records of the first 10 cases of nine surgeons were reviewed. We evaluated the 6-month-postoperative standing mortise and lateral radiographs for evidence of syndesmosis union and accuracy of tibial component implantation. Three surgeons were each in group I, group II, and group III. Average patient age at time of surgery was similar. Ankle arthritis was classified as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or osteoarthritis (OA) as follows: group I (7 RA, 23 OA), group II (7 RA, 23 OA), and group III (3 RA, 27 OA). RESULTS: In group I, there were nine intraoperative complications, four postoperative wound dehiscences, and three postoperative deep infections. Radiographic evaluation of the 26 cases with adequate postoperative roentgenograms revealed that 10/26 (38\%) had a delayed union of the syndesmosis. In group II, there were six intraoperative complications and two postoperative wound problems: an early anterior wound problem and a delayed lateral wound breakdown. Radiographic evaluation of the 26 cases with adequate postoperative roentgenograms revealed that 13/26 (50\%) had a delayed union of the syndesmosis. In group III, there were four intraoperative complications and four postoperative wound problems–all healed with local supportive care with one requiring lateral hardware removal. Radiographic evaluation of the 26 cases with adequate postoperative roentgenograms revealed that 5/30 (17\%) had a delayed union of the syndesmosis. The initial series from these three groups are statistically indistinguishable with respect to rates of complications, revisions, or malalignment. CONCLUSION: No identified training method had a statistically demonstrable positive impact on preparing surgeons for performing total ankle replacement. Some of these findings are likely generic for total ankle replacements and not restricted to any class or design of implant. Surgeon initial use of total ankle replacement needs to be done with caution and serious consideration.},

The model included friction at the bearing surfaces and soft tissue restraint forces, including the effect of cruciate resection. Predictions from the model were compared with data from a Knee Simulating Machine. There was close agreement in the shapes of the curves and in the magnitudes of the displacements and rotations under most conditions. The model predicted major differences in kinematics when friction between metal and polyethylene was included, the differences being even greater at the friction levels associated with small embedded acrylic particles. Soft tissue restraint was shown to reduce the displacements and rotations for tibial surfaces of low constraint but for moderate to high constraint, the soft tissues affected the kinematics only slightly. When the model was used to predict the motions for different condylar geometries, widely different contact paths on the tibial surface were determined. This suggested that condylar geometries which appeared to be generally similar, could have important differences in kinematics, function and wear.},

The analysis was then repeated using different mechanical signals to drive the remodelling algorithm. The results of these simulations were then compared to the patient-specific clinical data, to distinguish which of the candidate signals produced predictions consistent with the clinical evidence. Good agreement was found for a range of strain energy based signals and also deviatoric remodelling signals.

After exclusion criteria were met, 1814 index knee revisions in 1627 patients were included in the final cohort with more than 50\% of the revisions done for loosening and extensor mechanism problems and more than 80\% of the revisions involving the femoral, tibial, or both components. Three hundred seventy-three knees subsequently have been reoperated on one or more times. The average time from index revision total knee arthroplasty to the first reoperation was 3.5 years (range, 1 day-19 years). Of the 1814 index revision total knee arthroplasties, 373 (20\%) had 593 reoperations in 336 patients. The cumulative risks of first reoperation at 5, 10, and 15 years were 16.1\% (95\% CI, 14.2, 17.9), 26\% (95\% CI, 23.4, 28.6), and 31.4\% (95\% CI, 30.2, 39), respectively. There was no difference in risk to first reoperation when comparing the decades in which the index revisions were done (1970-1980, 1981-1990, and 1991-2000). There was a trend toward a higher cumulative risk of first time reoperations for deep infection, loosening, and instability in the last decade, but with the numbers available this was not statistically significant. The prevalence of reoperations in this large series of index revision total knee arthroplasties done for aseptic reasons was surprisingly high. Despite substantial improvements during the past 3 decades in component design, surgical technique, and prevention of infection, patients who have a revision total knee arthroplasty are at substantial risk of having one or more subsequent problems that result in a reoperation.},

	abstract = {Age-related reductions in the thickness and number of trabeculae in vertebral trabecular bone have been documented by several workers, yet the relative effects of these changes on mechanical properties are not known. We developed a two-dimensional model of human vertebral trabecular bone and investigated its mechanical behavior using finite element analysis. The stress-strain behavior, failure mode, and strain distributions predicted using the model were consistent with those observed for vertebral trabecular bone under compressive loading. Random reductions in the number of trabeculae reduced the modulus and strength of the models two to five times more than uniform reductions in the thickness of trabeculae that caused the same loss of bone volume. For example, randomly removing longitudinal trabeculae to achieve a reduction in density of 10\% reduced the strength by approximately 70\%, whereas removing the same amount of bone by uniformly reducing the thickness of the longitudinal trabeculae only reduced the strength by approximately 20\%. For a simulation of aged bone, in which the thickness and number of trabeculae were reduced concurrently, the strength was 23\% of its intact ("young") value. When the bone mass of the aged model was restored to its intact level by increasing the thickness but not the number of trabeculae, the strength increased by 60\%, but was still only 37\% of its intact value. These combined findings, based on a two-dimensional, idealized model of vertebral trabecular bone, illustrate the importance of maintaining trabecular number and suggest that it may not be possible to restore bone strength following a period of advanced bone loss if a substantial number of trabeculae have been resorbed. Thus, until treatments exist that can increase trabecular number, the most effective treatment strategy is to prevent the degradation of bone strength by maintaining the number of trabeculae at a healthy level.},

	abstract = {Experimental evidence indicates that the surface geometry of bone-interfacing implants influences the nature and rate of tissues formed around implants. In a previously reported animal model study, we showed that non-functional, press-fitted porous-surfaced implants placed in rabbit femoral condyle sites osseointegrated more rapidly than plasma-sprayed implants. We hypothesized that the accelerated osseointegration observed with the porous-surfaced design was the result of this design providing a local mechanical environment that was more favourable for bone formation. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis using finite element analysis and homogenization methods to predict the local strains in the pre-mineralized tissues formed around porous-surfaced and plasma-sprayed implants. We found that, for loading perpendicular to the implant interface, the porous surface structure provided a large region that experienced low distortional and volumetric strains, whereas the plasma-sprayed implant provided little local strain protection to the healing tissue. The strain protected region, which was within the pores of the sintered porous surface layer. corresponded to the region where the difference in the amount of mineralization between the two implant designs was the greatest. Low distortional and volumetric strains are believed to favour osteogenesis, and therefore the model results provide initial support for the hypothesis that the porous-surfaced geometry provides a local mechanical environment that favours more rapid bone formation in certain situations.},

The design for a controlled stiffness prosthesis is proposed and a preliminary analytical investigation performed to assess its predicted performance before fabrication of a prototype component. The novel prosthesis consisted of a cobalt-chrome core and a flexible composite outer layer. Varying the composite layer thickness allowed the prosthesis stiffness to be controlled. Three variants of the controlled stiffness prosthesis were critically assessed using the finite element method and their predicted performance compared with those of conventional prosthesis designs. The potential for stress shielding was assessed by examining the periosteal strain energy and the potential for migration assessed by examining the endosteal minimum principal cancellous bone stresses. Both the conventional and controlled stiffness implants performed poorly as press-fit prostheses. All the press-fit prostheses generated high cancellous bone stresses, suggesting that excessive migration of these implants would be likely. The controlled stiffness implants performed better than the conventional implants when bonded to the surrounding bone. Although the controlled stiffness implants did not eliminate stress shielding of the calcar, they produced higher strain energies than the conventional designs. The findings of this study are that osseointegrated controlled stiffness implants may perform better than current osseointegrated cementless prostheses and therefore it is worth while progressing to the next stage, of prototyping an implant.},

	abstract = {The study focused on the influence of the implant material stiffness on stress distribution and micromotion at the interface of bone defect implants. We hypothesized that a low-stiffness implant with a modulus closer to that of the surrounding trabecular bone would yield a more homogeneous stress distribution and less micromotion at the interface with the bony bed. To prove this hypothesis we generated a three-dimensional, non-linear, anisotropic finite element (FE) model. The FE model corresponded to a previously developed animal model in sheep. A prismatic implant filled a standardized defect in the load-bearing area of the trabecular bone beneath the tibial plateau. The interface was described by face-to-face contact elements, which allow press fits, friction, sliding, and gapping. We assumed a physiological load condition and calculated contact pressures, shear stresses, and shear movements at the interface for two implants of different stiffness (titanium: E=110 GPa; composite: E=2.2 GPa). The FE model showed that the stress distribution was more homogeneous for the low-stiffness implant. The maximum pressure for the composite implant (2.1 MPa) was lower than for the titanium implant (5.6 MPa). Contrary to our hypothesis, we found more micromotion for the composite (up to 6 m) than for the titanium implant (up to 4.5 m). However, for both implants peak stresses and micromotion were in a range that predicts adequate conditions for the osseointegration. This was confirmed by the histological results from the animal studies.},

	abstract = {From the 1860s to the early 1980s, the process that fitted bone architecture and mass to function had been investigated and characterized. It was known that increases in exercise were associated with increased bone mass, and that disuse caused osteopaenia, but the mechanisms by which those processes were regulated was not understood. The idea that osteocytes, the cells embedded in bone, were sensitive to the effects of mechanical loading was attractive, yet there was almost no experimental support for it, at least in part because the cells were considered inaccessible for study. In 1984, the techniques devised by Chayen and his co-workers were focused on this area. By analysis of the activity of the enzyme glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase in osteocytes in sections of avian bone that had been subjected to brief periods of applied mechanical loading, we showed for the first time that osteocytes could respond within a few minutes to mechanical stimulation. The lack of elevation of activity of other glycolytic enzymes led to the conclusion that this elevation was due to increased activity of the pentose shunt pathway, which was likely to be associated with increased production of reducing equivalents for biosynthesis, and ribose sugars for RNA synthesis. This was the first demonstration of an ability of osteocytes to respond to an external mechanical event and in effect provided a mechanistic link for the fundamental principle of what is known as Wolff's law of bone remodelling. These studies were dependent on several technical advances brought together in the Chayen Cellular Biology Laboratory at the Kennedy Institute. The ability to make cryosections of undecalcified bone, to perform cytochemical analysis of (soluble) enzyme activities by use of colloid stabilizers in the reaction medium, and finally to measure accurately the coloured reaction products by microdensitometry (which avoided optical heterogeneity errors) combined to provide a powerful way to explore bone cell function in situ. In the intervening years since then, similar studies have become routine, and the impact of molecular biological advances in hard tissues have remained dependent on techniques pioneered in the Chayen laboratory. During such studies, other advances have spun off, so that osteocyte gene expression has been analysed in samples taken from sections where the precise tissue characteristics were known, leading to advances in understanding of intercellular signalling mechanisms in bone by differential display, and the role of apoptosis in osteocytes in regulation of osteoclastic resorption. Still more recently, materials extracted from undecalcified sections have been used in gene array studies to discover new candidate genes with a role in the adaptive mechanism. Without Joe Chayen's involvement in this area, which now impacts on almost all bone biological science either directly or indirectly, our understanding of the pathophysiology of osteoporosis would have been very different.},

Predicting the bone remodeling that results from the use of a given hip implant would facilitate the design of a prosthesis that would optimize bone adaptation. This report combines the results of finite element stress analysis of the AML prosthesis implanted in vitro into a proximal femur with quantitative bone mineral density measured in vivo in the medial and lateral aspects of human femora at periods after implantation. Unimplanted femora were also analyzed for comparison purposes. Bone density measurements were obtained using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Absolute values of the maximum principal stress and maximum shear stress calculated in the femur at the time of implantation accurately predict bone density resulting from remodeling caused by the prosthesis. The calculated initial strain was not found to correlate with resultant bone density. These findings suggest that the results of stress analyses using three dimensional models of femora implanted in vitro can predict bone remodeling around prostheses and may be used to quantitate appropriate design criteria for total hip replacements.},

The model is based on a finite element representation of individual trabecular struts in which the material properties of the subtrabecular elements are constant. The remodeling stimulus is strain energy density, sensed and communicated through the osteocytic network as proposed by Mullender et al. We propose a modified osteocyte communication scheme that incorporates bone-lining cells and examines the implications of set point locations in one or the other of these two cell types. This model produces trabecular struts that align with its general loading direction. Placing the set point in the bone-lining cells rather than in the osteocytes makes the model more sensitive to changes in the other biological parameters. Introduction of a dead zone causes the model to reach a less oscillatory equilibrium in fewer iterations and produces better in-filling of trabecular strut intersections. The model gravitates to equilibrium states in which the average strain energy density is inversely proportional to the bone volume fraction to the 3.2 power.},

Bone mineral density (BMD) is an important measure of bone strength and quality. The aim of this prospective study was to measure the quantitative changes in BMD in the distal femur after cemented total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in osteoarthrotic knee joints. Sixty-nine patients with TKA were scanned postoperatively using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) within a week of surgery, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. An average decrease in bone density of 17.1\% (mean range of 12.1-22.8\%) was measured adjacent to the prosthesis at the 12-month follow-up (repeated measures ANOVA P{\textless}0.0005). Bone loss was most rapid during the first 3 months after TKA. The clinical status and function parameters of the knee joint, evaluated by the American Knee Society (AKS) score, had improved significantly on the preoperative values at the three- and 12-month follow-ups (P{\textless}0.0005). However, improvement in the AKS score was not associated with periprosthetic BMD change (P=0.204), whereas age (P=0.067) and body mass index (P=0.019) correlated with BMD loss for the total metaphyseal region of interest (ROI), by repeated measures ANOVA. We suggest that the observed periprosthetic bone loss was mainly the result of prosthesis-related stress-shielding.},

	abstract = {Finite element analysis has been used extensively in the study of bone loading and implant performance, such as in the femur. The boundary conditions applied vary widely, generally producing excessive femoral deformation, and although it has been shown that the muscle forces influence femoral deflections and loading, little consideration has been given to the displacement constraints. It is hypothesised that careful application of physiologically based constraints can produce physiological deformation, and therefore straining, of the femur. Joint contact forces and a complete set of muscle forces were calculated based on the geometry of the Standardised Femur using previously validated musculoskeletal models. Five boundary condition cases were applied to a finite element model of the Standardised Femur: (A) diaphyseally constrained with hip contact and abductor forces; (B) case A plus vasti forces; (C) case A with complete set of muscle forces; (D) distally constrained with all muscle forces; (E) physiological constraints with all muscle forces. It was seen that only the physiological boundary conditions, case E, produced physiological deflections ({\textless}2.0mm) of the femoral head in both the coronal and sagittal planes, which resulted in minimal reaction forces at the constrained nodes. Strains in the mid-diaphysis varied by up to 600mu-strain under walking loads and 1000mu-strain under stair climbing loads. The mode of loading, as indicated by the strain profiles on the cortex also varied substantially under these boundary conditions, which has important consequences for studies that examine localised bone loading such as fracture or bone remodelling simulations.},

	abstract = {Strategies to counteract bone loss with exercise have had fairly limited success, particularly those regimens subjecting the skeleton to mild activity such as walking. In contrast, here we show that it is possible to induce substantial bone formation with low-magnitude loading. In two distinct in vivo models of bone adaptation, we found that insertion of a 10-s rest interval between each load cycle transformed a locomotion-like loading regime that minimally influenced osteoblast activity into a potent anabolic stimulus. In the avian ulna model, the minimal mean (+SE) periosteal labeled surface (Ps.LS) observed in the intact contralateral bones (1.6 +/- 1.5\%) was doubled after 3 consecutive days of low-magnitude loading (3.8 +/- 1.5\%; p = 0.03). However, modifying the regimen by inserting 10 s of rest between each load cycle significantly enhanced the periosteal response (21.9 +/- 4.5\%; p = 0.03). In the murine tibia model, 5 consecutive days of 100 low-magnitude loading cycles did not significantly alter mean periosteal bone formation rate (BFR) compared with contralateral bones (0.011 +/- 0.005 microm3/microm2 per day vs. 0.021 +/- 0.013 microm3/microm2 per day). In contrast, separating each of 10 of the same loading cycles with 10 s of rest significantly elevated periosteal BFR (0.167 +/- 0.049 microm3/microm2 per day; p = 0.01). Endocortical bone formation parameters were not altered by any loading regimen in either model. We conclude that 10 s of rest between each load cycle of a low-magnitude loading protocol greatly enhances the osteogenic potential of the regimen.},

In vivo hip joint contact force measurements have been made using instrumented hip joint prostheses. However, to allow determination of the range of values of joint contact force and their directions relative to anatomical structures in a range of subject groups sufficient to form an agreed data base it is necessary to adopt a different approach without the use of an implanted transducer. The use of mathematical models of the lower limb to examine the forces in soft tissues and at the joints has provided valuable insight into internal loading conditions. Several authors have proposed mathematical musculo-skeletal models. However, there have been only limited attempts at validation of these models. It is possible to use the results of in vivo force measurements from instrumented prostheses to validate the results calculated using the mathematical models. In this study two subjects with instrumented hip joint prostheses were studied. Forces at the hip joints were calculated using a three-dimensional model of the leg. Walking at slow, normal and fast speeds (0.97â€“2.01 m/s), weight transfer from two to one leg and back again, and sit to stand were studied. Direct comparisons were made between the `gold standard' measured hip joint contact forces and the calculated forces. There was general agreement between the calculated and measured forces in both pattern and magnitude. There were, however, discrepancies. Reasons for these differences in results are discussed and possible model developments suggested.},

Sample Population- Bone specimens from the failure surface were obtained from 12 Thoroughbred racehorses with catastrophic injury and 2 non-racing horses with accidental long bone fracture. Methods- Bone specimens from the failure surface of each fracture were incubated with gold microspheres to label microcracks before examination at x50 to x60,000 using scanning electron microscopy. Microcracking at the failure surface was assessed using a visual analog scale. Results- Branching arrays or clusters of microcracks were seen over a range of magnifications in adapted subchondral bone in the distal end of the MC3/MT3 bone from racing Thoroughbreds with a catastrophic displaced condylar fracture. In the palmar/plantar region, microcracking was associated with the formation of an array of macroscopic cracks in the condylar groove. A different pattern of microcracking was seen in specimens of bone from distal metaphyseal and diaphyseal MC3/MT3 failure surfaces from Thoroughbred racehorses with catastrophic fracture and non-racing horses with an accidental diaphyseal long bone fracture. Few microcracks were seen and typically did not form branching arrays. Conclusion- These data suggest that propagation of condylar fracture in Thoroughbred racehorses is initiated by the formation of nanoscale microcracks in adapted subchondral bone that form during exercise-induced bone adaptation. Clinical Relevance- Accumulation and coalescence of branching microcracks into arrays or clusters appears to eventually lead to the development of macroscopic subchondral cracks in the condylar groove and initiation of a condylar fracture.},

This technique, however, is an extremely demanding procedure. The range of motion after total ankle replacement following posttraumatic arthritis is poor compared to the results of total ankle replacement for rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, these data are obtained yet only by a few experienced surgeons in specialized centers.

	abstract = {Customary nonuniform distributions of physiological bone strains are thought to evoke heterogeneous material adaptation in diaphyseal cortices of some limb bones. Recent studies of artiodactyl calcanei have suggested that the regional prevalence of specific mechanical strain features such as mode and magnitude correlate with specific variations in cortical bone ultrastructure, microstructure and mineralization. These data are also consistent with predictions of current algorithms of mechanically induced bone adaptation. However, detailed characterization of the customary functional strain environment of these bones is needed to understand better the mechanisms of these adaptations. An in vitro loading method and rosette strain gauges were used to record principal strains, maximum shear strains and principal strain angles at multiple locations on ten calcanei of adult male mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus hemionus). Each hind limb was fixed in an apparatus to mimic the mid-support phase of the gait and loaded via the Achilles tendon over a broad range of functional loads (0 to 2943 N). Strains were recorded on the craniolateral, craniomedial, caudal, medial and lateral cortices at middiaphysis. Loading variations included the progressive elimination of the ligament and tendon along the caudal calcaneus. The results showed that the cranial cortex experiences longitudinal compressive strains that are nearly equal to the principal minimum strains and that the caudal cortex receives longitudinal tensile strains that are nearly equal to the principal maximum strains. With a 981 N load, the mean principal compressive strain on the cranial cortex was -636Â±344 me (mean Â± S.D., N=9) and the mean principal tensile strain on the caudal cortex was 1112Â±68 me (N=9). In contrast to the cranial and caudal cortices, principal strains in the medial and lateral cortices displayed relatively large deviations from the longitudinal axis (medial, 24 Â° cranial; lateral, 27 Â° caudal). Although shear strains predominated at all gauge sites, variations in maximum shear strains showed no apparent regional pattern or consistent regional predominance. The plantar ligament and tendon of the superficial digital flexor muscle were shown to have important load-sharing functions. These results demonstrate that the functionally loaded artiodactyl calcaneus generally behaves like a cantilevered beam with longitudinal compression and tension strains predominating in opposing cranial and caudal cortices, respectively. Differences in osteon remodeling rates, osteon morphology and mineral content reported previously between the cranial and caudal cortices correlate, in part, with the magnitudes of the principal compressive and tensile strains, respectively. However, material differences that distinguish the medial and lateral cortices from the cranial and caudal cortices could not be primarily attributed to locally increased shear strains as previously suggested. Variations in osteon and/or collagen fiber orientation may correlate more strongly with principal strain direction.},

Such data would be useful in understanding the response of bone tissue to implants. Various artifacts can, however, degrade accuracy of the data. The aim of this study was to measure the artifactual errors produced in CT of a simulated femoral bone-titanium composite and to propose a method to correct for them. METHOD: A composite phantom that simulates cortical bone and a titanium implant was designed and constructed. The phantom was scanned and the image data were analyzed over a range of thresholds with image analysis software developed for this study. The outer (OD) and inner (ID) diameter and the CT number of the cortical bone, with and without titanium, were measured over a range of cortical thicknesses. RESULTS: While ID can be accurately measured by choosing the proper threshold (800 HU), OD, even at optimal threshold, will be underestimated by approximately 2\%. If a proper threshold is selected, CT number can also be accurately determined. Errors of up to 5\%, however, are produced by titanium unless corrected by proper threshold selection. CONCLUSION: Intramedullary titanium is not a deterrent to obtaining accurate measurements of cortical bone dimensions and properties. Proper choice of thresholds for image analysis of CT scan data can yield accuracy and precision of {\textless} or = 2\%.},

	abstract = {The assignment of bone tissue material properties is a fundamental step in the generation of subject-specific finite element models from computed tomography data. Aim of the present work is to investigate the influence of the material mapping algorithm on the results predicted by the finite element analysis. Two models, a coarse and a refined one, of a human ileum, femur and tibia, were generated from CT data and used for the tests. In addition a convergence analysis was carried out for the femur model, using six refinement levels, to verify whether the inclusion of the material properties would significantly alter the convergence behaviour of the mesh. The results showed that the choice of the mapping algorithm influences the material distribution. However, this did not always propagate into the finite element results. The difference between the maximum Von Mises stress remained always lower than 10\%, apart one case when it reached the 13\%. However, the global behaviour of the meshes showed more marked differences between the two algorithms: in the finer meshes of the two long bones 20-30\% of the bone volume showed differences in the predicted Von Mises stresses greater than 10\%. The convergence behaviour of the model was not worsened by the introduction of inhomogeneous material properties. The software was made available in the public domain.},

This study was performed to investigate the effect of ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate (OKG) administration during the last 7 weeks of life on structural properties, mineralization, and mechanical endurance of skeleton in turkeys at slaughter. Healthy HB Medium Bronze female turkeys were randomly assigned to two weight-matched groups at the age of 12 weeks. OKG was administered orally to the experimental group (N = 17) at the dose of 0.4 g/kg body weight per day, while the control group (N = 16) received an equal dose of the vehicle. The turkeys were slaughtered at the age of 19 weeks and the tibiae were isolated for analysis. The effect of OKG on skeletal system development in turkeys was evaluated in relation to both geometrical and mechanical properties as well as quantitative computed tomography (QCT). Free amino acids concentrations were assessed with the use of ion-exchange chromatography. Significantly increased bone mineral density of the trabecular and the cortical bone of tibia in the turkeys given OKG for the last 7 weeks of production cycle were observed (P {\textless} 0.05). OKG administration improved mechanical endurance of the tibia estimated by the three-point bending test (P {\textless} 0.01). Plasma amino acid analyses showed increased level of aspartate, proline, alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, and ornithine (all P {\textless} 0.05) after OKG treatment, whereas cystathionine concentration was decreased (P = 0.03). Obtained results indicate that oral OKG administration has beneficial effects on skeletal development in fast growing turkeys and this effect is connected with increased amino acid synthesis. These observations may serve to improve skeletal properties in birds, especially when considering that skeletal disorders often affect the tibia and the proper function of the skeletal system plays an essential role in animal welfare and poultry production.},

	abstract = {We have conducted a series of fatigue tests on samples of bovine compact bone loaded in cyclic torsion. The fatigue strength (i.e. the range of stress needed to cause failure in a given number of cycles) was found to be lower than the fatigue strength of the same material in compression by more than a factor of two. We also tested intact chicken metatarsals and found a similar reduction in strength compared to compression testing of chicken tibiae. These results were predicted using a theoretical model in which fatigue failure was assumed to be dependant on the growth of microcracks, oriented approximately parallel to the bone's longitudinal axis but having misorientation angles of up to 30Â°. An effective stress range was derived which is a function of the normal and shear stresses, and thus of the Mode I and Mode II stress intensities experienced by the crack. These results may have important consequences for the understanding of fatigue in bone in vivo; relatively small amounts of longitudinal shear stress, which are often ignored in analysis, may contribute significantly to fatigue failures. This may shed light on the phenomenon of stress fractures and on the need for repair and adaptation in living bone.},

Three versions of a proximal tibial prosthesis were examined: an all polyethylene press-fit design; a metal backed, stemmed press-fit design and a (horizontally) cemented metal backed, stemmed design. All three designs had published migration and survivorship data. The objectives of the study were (i) to compare the stresses generated by each of the tibial components, (ii) examine the influence of the resected surface morphology and (iii) compare the initial cancellous bone stresses with the published migration and survivorship data. The all polyethylene prosthesis generated the highest cancellous bone stresses. Addition of a metal backing and a stem reduced the stresses, but the cemented device produced the lowest cancellous bone stresses. The surface morphology had a significant effect on the cancellous bone stresses generated by press-fit prostheses. As the bone-prosthesis contact area decreased, the peak cancellous bone stresses increased by as much as 243\%. The surface morphology had no effect on the cancellous bone stresses generated by the cemented implant. Good correlation was found between the predicted cancellous bone stresses and the migration and survivorship data, with the implant generating the highest cancellous bone stresses migrating the most and having the poorest survival rates at 5 year. The results support the hypothesis that the progressive failure of cancellous bone is a mechanism of implant migration regardless of the method of fixation and the implantation site.},

	abstract = {Surgical intervention of the knee joint routinely endeavors to recreate a physiologically normal joint loading environment. The loading conditions resulting from osteotomies, fracture treatment, ligament replacements, and arthroplasties of the knee are considered to have an impact on the long term clinical outcome; however, knowledge regarding in vivo loading conditions is limited. Using a previously validated musculoskeletal lower limb model, we predicted the tibio-femoral joint contact forces that occur in the human knee during the common daily activities of walking and stair climbing. The average resultant peak force during walking was 3.1 times body weight (BW) across four total hip arthroplasty patients. Inter-individual variations proved larger than the variation of forces for each patient repeating the same task. Forces through the knee were considerably larger during stair climbing than during walking: the average resultant peak force during stair climbing was 5.4 BW although peaks of up to 6.2 BW were calculated for one particular patient. Average anteroposterior peak shear components of 0.6 BW were determined during walking and 1.3 BW during stair climbing. These results confirm both the joint contact forces reported in the literature and the importance of muscular activity in creating high forces across the joint. The magnitudes of these forces, specifically in shear, have implications for all forms of surgical intervention in the knee. The data demonstrate that high contact and shear forces are generated during weight bearing combined with knee flexion angles greater than approximately 15 degrees. Clinically, the conditions that produce these larger contact forces should be avoided during post-operative rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {Finite element models have been widely employed in an effort to quantify the stress and strain distribution around implanted prostheses and to explore the influence of these distributions on their long-term stability. In order to provide meaningful predictions, such models must contain an appropriate reflection of mechanical properties. Detailed geometrical and density information is now readily available from CT scanning. However, despite the use of phantoms, a method of determining mechanical properties (or elastic constants) from bone density has yet to be made available in a usable form.In this study, a cadaveric bone was CT scanned and its natural frequencies were measured using modal analysis. Using the geometry obtained from the CT scan data, a finite element mesh was created with the distribution of density established by matching the mass of the FE bone model with the mass of the cadaveric bone. The maximum values of the orthotropic elastic constants were then established by matching the predictions from FE modal analyses to the experimental natural frequencies, giving a maximum error of 7.8\% over 4 modes of vibration. Finally, the elastic constants of the bone derived from the analyses were compared with those measured using ultrasound techniques. This produced a difference of {\textless}1\% for both the maximum density and axial Young's Modulus. This study has thereby produced an orthotropic finite element model of a human femur. More importantly, however, is the implication that it is possible to create a valid FE model by simply comparing the FE results with the measured resonant frequency of the CT scanned bone.},

In this study the computational methods were described and validated using digital phantom datasets. Then the algorithms were applied for in vivo datasets and the sensitivity of each indicator was evaluated. The validation showed that the two algorithms are accurate from a computational point of view. Moreover, the in vivo testing demonstrated that the developed methods provide reasonable quantitative indicators of the stem positioning in the femoral CT dataset.},

A composite replica of the human femur was scanned and the CT images processed using three different methods, a manual procedure; the border-tracing algorithm; and a threshold-based method. The resulting contours were used to estimate the accuracy of the implemented procedure. The two software techniques were more accurate than the manual procedure. Then, these two procedures were applied to an in vivo CT data set in order to determine to most critical region for repeatability. Only for the images located in this region, the repeatability measurement was carried out for six in vivo CT data sets to evaluate the inter-femur repeatability.

	abstract = {A systematic mechanical and histologic evaluation of design variables affecting bone apposition to various biocompatible materials was undertaken. The variables investigated included material elastic modulus, material surface texture, as well as material surface composition. The implant materials included polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), low-temperature isotropic (LTI) pyrolytic carbon, commercially pure (C.P.) titanium, and aluminum oxide (Al2O3). Implant surface texture was varied by either polishing or grit-blasting the various materials. Implant surface composition was varied by applying a coating of ultra-low temperature isotropic (ULTI) pyrolytic carbon to the various implants. A total of 12 types of implants were evaluated in vivo by placement transcortically in the femora of adult mongrel dogs for a period of 32 weeks. Following sacrifice, mechanical push-out testing was performed to determine interface shear strength and interface shear stiffness. The results obtained from mechanical testing indicate that for implants fixed by direct bone apposition, interface stiffness and interface shear strength are not significantly affected by either implant elastic modulus or implant surface composition. Varying surface texture, however, significantly affected the interface response to the implants. For each elastic modulus group the roughened surfaced implants exhibited greater strengths than the corresponding smooth surfaced implants. Undecalcified histologic evaluation of the implants demonstrated that the roughened implants exhibited direct bone apposition, whereas the smooth implants exhibited various degrees of fibrous tissue encasement. Thus, for implants utilizing direct bone apposition fixation, it appears that of the parameters investigated, implant surface texture is the most significant.},

In this study, bovine (n = 37) and human (n = 32) trabecular bone was investigated in vitro and in vivo to reveal relationships between mechanical properties, mineral density, and US parameters BUA and SOS. To fulfill these aims, clinical US and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) techniques, as well as dynamic and destructive mechanical testing, were utilized. BUA correlated positively and linearly with BMD(areal) only in human calcaneus of low or moderate density (r = 0.849, n = 32, p {\textless} 0.01). When calcaneal areas with high BMD(areal) were included in the analysis, however, the in vivo study revealed that the BUA-BMD(areal) relationship could be described by a second-order polynomial fit (r(2) = 0.618, n = 408). In high-density human or bovine bone, the BUA-bone density relationship was negative. In the in vitro assessment, BUA correlated linearly and negatively with volumetric BMD (BMD(vol)) (r = -0.540, n = 29, p {\textless} 0.01) and with storage modulus, as measured at 1 Hz (r = -0.505, n = 28, p {\textless} 0.01). A weak positive correlation was found between BUA and mechanical loss tangent (r = 0.322, n = 28, p {\textless} 0.1). SOS correlated strongly positively with BMD(vol) (r = 0.888, n = 29, p {\textless} 0.01), as well with storage modulus (r = 0.649, n = 28, p {\textless} 0.01). In contrast, SOS correlated negatively with loss tangent (r = -0.417, n = 28, p {\textless} 0.05). When tested dynamically in the frequency range of 0.01-22.7 Hz, bovine trabecular bone was only slightly viscoelastic. In summary, the most accurate parameters for measuring storage modulus and strength of bovine trabecular bone were SOS and BMD(vol), respectively. BUA failed to predict the mechanical properties of high-density trabecular bone. In vivo mapping of the calcaneus revealed the importance of standardized and reproducible localization of the measurement site for the validity of BUA values.},

The quantity, yield strain, is highly dependent on specific definitions of the yield point and the point of zero strain. For this study the yield point was defined by a 0.0003 offset criterion, and the point of zero strain was defined as the point where the tangent at 15 percent of yield crosses zero. The results using these definitions were compared with results using yield strain values determined by other definitions of the yield point and zero strain. The correlations between yield strain and trabecular orientation, structural density and bone density changed very little for differing definitions of yield. The results suggest that yield strain in cancellous bone is isotropic or independent of textural anisotropy, so the yield behaviour may be characterized by a maximum strain yield criterion. The results also suggest that the primary mode of yield in cancellous bone is buckling of the trabeculae.},

Mean errors of 1.1 and 5.0 percent in the measured shear moduli for cancellous and cortical bone, respectively, were found at a misalignment angle of 10 degrees. Although, cancellous bone tissue was assumed to have orthotropic elastic symmetry, the possibility of the greater symmetry of transverse isotropy was investigated. When the nine orthotropic elastic constants were forced to approximate the five transverse isotropic elastic constants, errors of over 60 percent were introduced. Therefore, it was concluded that cancellous bone is truly orthotropic and not transversely isotropic. A similar but less strong result for cortical bone tissue was obtained.},

	abstract = {A new trend in the usage of functional modeling in computer science has been formed during several last years. One of the basic fields developing in a lot of departments is modeling with the implicitly defined objects. The implicit definition (in contrast to the parametric definition of the object) is the most compact description of the model, which exactly defines the object surface (volumetric data). One of the basic modeling methods is modeling with the Boolean operations. The Boolean operations allow creating the CSG tree structure from the implicitly defined objects. CSG tree can be further used in the visualization methods. Visualization of an implicitly defined object is possible by using several methods. One group of these methods represents direct methods like ray tracing or ray casting, in the second group belong surface approximation methods with triangle mesh like Marching cubes or Marching tetrahedra. Since, this kind of description has many benefits, there is a tendency to represent the objects described by triangle mesh with implicit equation. Area of the implicit modeling is very large. This offered work contains an overview of methods used for implicitization of objects defined by the polygonal mesh or point-cloud data. The mathematical methods for implicitization are briefly introduced, too. The main goal of the research is oriented to the Radial Basis Function method. Basic aspects, possible solutions, advantages and disadvantages of presented algorithms are discussed. The outlook of our previous work and future work is presented.},

	abstract = {Most standard methods to predict bone quality are merely based on apparent density measurements. However, apparent density alone does neither explain all variation of the mechanical properties nor does it account for the structural anisotropy of trabecular bone. Thus, apparent density alone might not be sufficient to accurately predict the quality of bone. This study investigates if a new approach based on microstructural computer models can provide additional and relevant information on bone quality. 58 human trabecular bone samples from the femoral head were measured with a 3-D micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT) system providing a voxel representation of the bone microarchitecture with a resolution of 28 microns. Based on such representations, the orthotropic stiffness matrices and the principal directions were computed for 5 mm cubes with microstructural Finite Element Analysis (FEA). For a subset of six samples the moduli were then validated with tri-axial mechanical compression tests. The results show that on average 15\% of the variation of the elastic properties are not explained by bone volume fraction. Differences of elastic properties between samples with the same bone volume fraction range up to 53\%. The variation of the degree of anisotropy is unrelated to that of the bone volume fraction. Finally, the direction-dependent stiffness of the trabecular bone differs by a factor of four, indicating that one single (isotropic) modulus as predicted from apparent density measurements might not be adequat. It is concluded that micro-CT-based FEA provides new and additional information about anisotropy and mechanical properties in a direct and non-destructive way, and thus will be important in the future for advanced failure risk prediction. An extension to patient examinations using high-resolution CT or MRI techniques is envisaged.},

	abstract = {Prevention of osteoporotic fractures requires accurate methods to detect the increase in bone fragility at an early disease stage as well as effective therapies to reduce the risk of bone fractures. Presently the prediction of the patient-specific bone fracture risk is primarily based on bone density, since this is the only parameter which can routinely be measured in vivo. However, these predictions might not always be precise because the fracture risk is also determined by the bone microarchitecture and the bone's loading conditions. The aim of this paper is to introduce and evaluate new methods which could contribute to a better quantification of bone fracture risk. Recently, a new approach, combining computational engineering methods (finite element (FE) method) and 3D high-resolution imaging techniques, has been introduced which can account not only for bone density but also for microarchitecture and loading conditions. High-resolution imaging techniques allow acquisition of 3D images of the bone microarchitecture, whereas FE methods applied to these images allow very precise calculation of the mechanical properties of bone. However, such a detailed FE analysis was not feasible for bone in vivo mainly because the resolution was not sufficient to measure the bone microarchitecture. It is shown here, from preliminary results, that the FE approach based on high-resolution images from a new CT scanner now allows prediction of the mechanical behavior of peripheral bones in vivo. It is expected that, eventually, the FE approach will lead to a better patient-specific fracture risk prediction than earlier methods based on bone density alone. Hence, with this new approach, it might be possible to detect the increase in bone fragility at an early stage of osteoporosis and it might also be possible to evaluate treatments more accurately.},

	volume = {39},
	abstract = {Determining accurate density-mechanical property relationships for trabecular bone is critical for correct characterization of this important structure-function relation. When testing any excised specimen of trabecular bone, an unavoidable experimental artifact originates from the sides of the specimen where peripheral trabeculae lose their vertical load-bearing capacity due to interruption of connectivity, a phenomenon denoted here as the 'side-artifact'. We sought in this study to quantify the magnitude of such side-artifact errors in modulus measurement and to do so as a function of the trabecular architecture and specimen size. Using parametric computational analysis of high-resolution micro-CT-based finite-element models of cores of elderly human vertebral trabecular bone, a specimen-specific correction factor for the side-artifact was quantified as the ratio of the side-artifact-free apparent modulus (Etrue) to the apparent modulus that would be measured in a typical experiment (Emeasured). We found that the width over which the peripheral trabeculae were mostly unloaded was between 0.19 and 0.58 mm. The side-artifact led to an underestimation error in Etrue of over 50\% in some specimens, having a mean (+/-SD) of 27+/-11\%. There was a trend for the correction factor to linearly increase as volume fraction decreased (p=0.001) and as mean trabecular separation increased (p{\textless}0.001). Further analysis indicated that the error increased substantially as specimen size decreased. Two methods used for correcting for the side-artifact were both successful in bringing Emeasured into statistical agreement with Etrue. These findings have important implications for the interpretation of almost all literature data on trabecular bone mechanical properties since they indicate that such properties need to be adjusted to eliminate the substantial effects of side-artifacts in order to provide more accurate estimates of in situ behavior.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to determine talar movement (e.g., talar rotation and talar shift during (dorsiflexion/plantarflexion) with respect to the tibia in the normal ankle, in the fused ankle, and in the replaced ankle by currently used prosthetic designs. METHODS: A 6-df device with an axial load of 200 N and a four-camera high-speed video system were used for the measurement of the range of motion in six fresh-frozen cadaveri leg specimens. While moving the foot through the whole range of motion for plantarflexion/dorsiflexion, segmental motion of the marked bones of the foot and shank were measured dynamically. Rotation and medial-lateral shift of the talus were then calculated with regard to flexion position of the foot. RESULTS: In the normal ankle, plantarflexion movement was coupled with talar inversion of 3.5 degrees, and dorsiflexion movement with talar eversion of 1.0 degree, in totally accounting for 4.5 degrees of talar rotation. While both the HINTEGRA and the S.T.A.R. prostheses did not show changes to the normal condition during the dorsiflexion/plantarflexion cycle (p {\textless} .05), talar rotation had a 60\% decrease (p {\textless} .05) for the AGILITY prosthesis. In the normal ankle joint, a lateral talar shift of 1.4 mm was found to occur during dorsiflexion, and a lateral talar shift of 5.2 mm during plantarflexion. In both, the HINTEGRA and S.T.A.R. ankles, talar shift was converted into medial direction during dorsiflexion of the foot (difference to normal: p {\textless} .05), whereas talar shift in the lateral direction was found to occur during plantarflexion of the foot which was comparable to the normal ankle. The AGILITY ankle evidenced an 80\% decrease of talar shift (p {\textless} .05) during the whole dorsiflexion/plantarflexion cycle. DISCUSSION: The two-component ankle (AGILITY) obviously tends to restrict tremendously talar motion within the ankle mortise, whereas the three-component ankles (HINTEGRA, S.T.A.R.) seem to allow talar range of motion comparable to that in the normal ankle. It is suggested that such a restriction of talar motion results in an increase of stress forces within and around the prosthesis, leading to polyethylene wear and potential loosening at the bone-implant interfaces. Therefore, a successful prosthetic design for the ankle should consist of three components that are shaped as anatomically as possible to provide a normal range of motion and to allow the full transmission of movement transfer between foot and shank and unconstrained movement of the talus within the ankle mortise.},

	volume = {34},
	abstract = {Attaching tantalum markers to prostheses for Roentgen stereophotogrammetry (RSA) may be difficult and is sometimes even impossible. In this study, a model-based RSA method that avoids the attachment of markers to prostheses is presented and validated. This model-based RSA method uses a triangulated surface model of the implant. A projected contour of this model is calculated and this calculated model contour is matched onto the detected contour of the actual implant in the RSA radiograph. The difference between the two contours is minimized by variation of the position and orientation of the model. When a minimal difference between the contours is found, an optimal position and orientation of the model has been obtained. The method was validated by means of a phantom experiment. Three prosthesis components were used in this experiment: the femoral and tibial component of an Interax total knee prosthesis (Stryker Howmedica Osteonics Corp., Rutherfort, USA) and the femoral component of a Profix total knee prosthesis (Smith \& Nephew, Memphis, USA). For the prosthesis components used in this study, the accuracy of the model-based method is lower than the accuracy of traditional RSA. For the Interax femoral and tibial components, significant dimensional tolerances were found that were probably caused by the casting process and manual polishing of the components surfaces. The largest standard deviation for any translation was 0.19mm and for any rotation it was 0.52 degrees. For the Profix femoral component that had no large dimensional tolerances, the largest standard deviation for any translation was 0.22mm and for any rotation it was 0.22 degrees. From this study we may conclude that the accuracy of the current model-based RSA method is sensitive to dimensional tolerances of the implant. Research is now being conducted to make model-based RSA less sensitive to dimensional tolerances and thereby improving its accuracy.},

	abstract = {The bone remodeling process takes place at the surface of trabeculae and results in a non-uniform mineral distribution. This will affect the mechanical properties of cancellous bone, because the properties of bone tissue depend on its mineral content. We investigated how large this effect is by simulating several non-uniform mineral distributions in 3D finite element models of human trabecular bone and calculating the apparent stiffness of these models. In the 'linear model' we assumed a linear relation between mineral content and Young's modulus of the tissue. In the 'exponential model' we included an empirical exponential relation in the model. When the linear model was used the mineral distribution slightly changed the apparent stiffness, the difference varied between an 8\% decrease and a 4\% increase compared to the uniform model with the same BMD. The exponential model resulted in up to 20\% increased apparent stiffness in the main load-bearing direction. A thin less mineralized surface layer (28 microm) and highly mineralized interstitial bone (mimicking mineralization resulting from anti-resorptive treatment) resulted in the highest stiffness. This could explain large reductions in fracture risk resulting from small increases in BMD. The non-uniform mineral distribution could also explain why bone tissue stiffness determined using nano-indentation is usually higher than finite element (FE)-determined stiffness. We conclude that the non-uniform mineral distribution in trabeculae does affect the mechanical properties of cancellous bone and that the tissue stiffness determined using FE-modeling could be improved by including detailed information about mineral distribution in trabeculae in the models.},

	volume = {73},
	abstract = {Although the revision rates for modern knee prostheses have decreased drastically, the total number of revisions a year is increasing because many more primary knee replacements are being done. At the time of revision, bone loss is common, which compromises prosthetic stability. To improve stability, intramedullary stems are often used. The aim of this study was to estimate the effects of a stem, its diameter and the interface bonding conditions on patterns of the bone remodeling in the distal femur. We created finite element models of the distal half of a femur in which 4 types of knee prostheses were placed. The bone remodeling process was simulated using a strain-adaptive bone remodeling theory. The amount of such remodeling was determined by calculating the changes in bone mineral density in 9 regions of interest from simulated DEXA scans. The computer simulation model showed that revision prostheses tend to cause more bone resorption than primary ones, especially in the most distal regions. Predicted long-term bone loss due to a revision prosthesis with a thin stem equalled that around a prosthesis with an intercondylar box. However, strong regional differences were found–the stemmed prostheses having more bone loss in the most distal areas and some bone gain in the more proximal ones. A prosthesis with a thick stem led to an increase in bone loss. When the prosthesis-cement interface was bonded, more bone loss was predicted than with an unbonded interface. These results suggest that a stem which increases stability initially may reduce stability in the long term. This is due to an increase in stress shielding and bone resorption.},

	abstract = {Osteoporosis commonly is assessed by bone quantity, using bone mineral density (BMD) measurements from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, such a measure gives neither information about the integrity of the trabecular architecture nor about the mechanical properties of the constituting trabeculae. We investigated the feasibility of deriving the elastic modulus of the trabeculae (the tissue modulus) from computer simulation of mechanical testing by microfinite element analysis (muFEA) in combination with measurements of ultrasound speed of sound (SOS) and BMD measurements. This approach was tested on 15 postmortem bovine bone cubes. The apparent elastic modulus of the specimens was estimated from SOS measurements in combination with BMD. Then the trabecular morphology was reconstructed using microcomputed tomography (muCT). From the reconstruction a mesh for muFEA was derived, used to simulate mechanical testing. The tissue modulus was found by correlating the apparent moduli of the specimens as assessed by ultrasound with the ones as determined with muFEA. A mean tissue modulus of 4.5 GPa (SD, 0.69) was found. When adjusting the muFEA-determined elastic moduli of the entire specimens with their calculated tissue modulus, an overall correlation of R2 = 96\% with ultrasound-predicted values was obtained. We conclude that the apparent elastic stiffness characteristics as determined from ultrasound correlate linearly with those from muFEA. From both methods in combination, the elastic stiffness of the mineralized tissue can be determined as an estimator for mechanical tissue quality. This method can already be used for biopsy specimens, and potentially could be applicable in vivo as well, when clinical CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tools with adequate resolution reach the market. In this way, mechanical bone quality could be estimated more accurately in clinical practice.},

After removal of the bone graft, the cyclic loading was repeated for the unsupported situation. None of the grafts collapsed and all cement mantles stayed intact during the experiments.

	abstract = {The ability to provide a complete characterization of elastic properties of bone has vastly improved our understanding of trabecular bone mechanical properties. Based on this information, it was possible to validate several mechanical concepts related to the elastic behavior of trabecular bone that could not be validated earlier. With recently developed micro-CT scanners and the availability of large parallel computer systems, this technique has also enabled the determination of physiological bone tissue loading conditions from very large microFE models that can represent whole human bones in detail. Such analyses can provide the data needed for a better understanding of bone failure processes or cell mediated load adaptive remodeling processes. Computational demands for whole bone analyses, however, are still excessive. Unlike linear stress and strain analyses, the application of PFE to study non-linear processes, in particular bone failure mechanisms, is still in an early phase Results of recent studies, however, are promising and indicate that an accurate prediction of bone failure with these techniques is possible. Compelling features of such analyses are that they enable multi-axial failure criteria at the apparent level to be developed using primarily computational methods as well as that they can provide a basis for detailed analysis of micro-mechanics associated with trabecular failure at the apparent level. The application of microFE techniques to analyze bone in vivo is in an early stage as well. First results have indicated that, although the resolution of presently available in vivo imaging techniques (i.e. pQCT and MR) is much less than that of images used so far for uFE analyses, the technique can provide meaningful elastic properties of trabecular bone in vivo in most cases. It is expected that the remaining uncertainties in the microFE results can be eliminated as soon as the resolution of in vivo images is improved. With the fast developments in pQCT(47) and MR scanning, this will probably be in the near future.},

It is generally accepted that 'stress shielding' is the cause for this problem: after implantation of the prosthesis the surrounding bone is partially 'shielding' from load carrying and starts to resorb. One of the proposed answers to this problem is the application of press-fitted stems. These smooth-surfaced implants are thought to provoke higher proximal bone loading, and, hence, less stress shielding than bonded implants, because they are wedged into the femur every time when loaded. However, in a two-year experiment in dogs, similar amounts of resorption of the proximal cortex were found around press-fitted and bonded implants. The question arises how similar resorption patterns can develop under completely different stress conditions, and whether this phenomenon can be explained by adaptive bone remodeling theories based on Wolff's law. In the present study an answer was sought for this question. An advanced iterative computer simulation model was used to analyze the remodeling process in the animal experiment. Three-dimensional finite element models were constructed from the animal experimental configuration, in which smooth, press-fitted stems were applied unilaterally in the canine. The FE model was integrated with iterative remodeling procedures, validated in earlier studies. In the model an appropriate non-linear representation of the loose bone-implant interface was realized, also capable of simulating the proximal interface gap that was found around the uncoated implants. The simulation models predicted similar amounts of proximal bone loss and distal bone densification as found in the animal model. Hence, the cortical bone loss could indeed be predicted by the strain-adaptive bone remodeling theory. By unraveling the simulation process, the question stated above could be answered. Densification of the distal bone bed during the initial remodeling process was found to cause reduced axial stem displacement (elastic subsidence), decreasing the wedging effect of the stem and, hence, decreasing the loading of the proximal bone, resulting in proximal bone loss. Hence, whereas in the case of bonded stems the proximal resorption process develops monotonously to a new equilibrium, the process around smooth, press-fitted stems develops nonmonotonously. This is due primarily to the unbonded interface conditions and the development of a proximal fibrous membrane. The remodeling process then gradually causes the stem to be jammed in the distal diaphyses (proximal 'stress bypass').},

	abstract = {The apparent mechanical behavior of trabecular bone depends on properties at the tissue or trabecular level. Many investigators have attempted to determine trabecular tissue properties and loading. However, accuracy and applicability of all methods reported are limited. The small size of the trabeculae and a possible size effect are complicating factors when using traditional testing methods on single trabeculae. Other methods reported, using models that describe the trabecular structure, are of limited value because they consider bone as a repetitive structure in order to describe a reasonably large region of bone. The present study introduces a new finite-element method strategy that enables analysis of reasonably large regions of trabecular bone in full detail. The method uses three-dimensional serial reconstruction techniques to construct a large-scale FE model, by directly converting voxels to elements. A 5 mm cube of trabecular bone was modeled in this way, resulting in a FE model that consists of 296,679 elements. Special strategies were developed to solve the set of equations that results from the FE approach. Using this model in combination with experimental apparent data taken from the literature, the upper and lower boundaries for the tissue modulus were calculated to be 10.1 and 2.23 GPa, respectively. From the local stress and strain distributions it was concluded that the deformation mode of the trabeculae in the present cube was predominantly in bending. It was concluded that the method developed offers new perspectives for the study of trabecular bone.},

Equivalent-thickness models projected onto the mid-frontal plane were created for the natural, proximal tibia and for the proximal tibia with four different types of tibial plateau components. All components simulated bony ingrowth fixation, i.e. no cement layer existed between component and bone. In addition, the interface between component and bone was assumed to be intimately connected, representing complete bony ingrowth and a rigid state of fixation. Loads consisted of bi-condylar and uni-condylar forces. Results indicated that conventional plateau designs with central posts or multiple pegs led to higher stress magnitudes in the trabecular bone near the distal ends of the post/pegs and stress shielding at more proximal locations. A design without posts or pegs whose interface geometry mimics the epiphyseal plate minimizes bone stress shielding. An implant consisting of separate components covering each condyle was found effective in limiting component tilting and the consequent tensile stresses caused by non-symmetrical, uni-condylar loading.},

To study and predict trabecular bone elastic and yield properties, micro-finite element (micro-FE) models were successfully applied. However, trabecular bone strength predictions require micro-FE models incorporating post-yield behavior of trabecular bone tissue. Due to experimental difficulties, such data is currently not available. Here we used micro-FE modeling to determine failure behavior of trabecular bone tissue indirectly, by iteratively fitting FE simulation to experimental results. Failure parameters were fitted to an isotropic plasticity model based on Hill's yield function, using materially and geometrically nonlinear micro-FE models of seven bovine trabecular bone specimens. The predictive value of the averaged effective tissue properties was subsequently tested. The results showed that compression softening had to be included on the tissue level in order to accurately describe the apparent-level behavior of the bone specimens. A sensitivity study revealed that the simulated response was less sensitive to variations in the post-yield properties of the bone tissue than variations in the elastic and yield properties. Due to fitting of the tissue properties, apparent-level behavior could be accurately reproduced for each specimen separately. Predictions based on the averaged and fixed tissue properties were less accurate, due to inter-specimen variations in the tissue properties.},

The new EC rules on medical devices require a complete technical dossier for each produced custom-made device counter signed by the surgeon who 'prescribes' the custom-made device.

As a first step, in the present study a protocol based on finite element analysis (FEA) was developed and validated, to verify each custom-made hip stem in terms of mechanical strength. The study was carried out on 12 custom-made cementless hip stem designs already produced and implanted, for which the 3D solid model was available. Two of the selected designs were used for the method validation, comparing strain gauges measurements with the stresses predicted by the finite element (FE) model. Once the proposed methodology was verified, all the remaining stem designs were analysed. The developed protocol made possible a complete analysis in less than 4 h; its accuracy (7-8\% on the strain gauge measurements) was considered acceptable for the specific application.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate comparatively five methods for automating mesh generation (AMG) when used to mesh a human femur. The five AMG methods considered were: mapped mesh, which provides hexahedral elements through a direct mapping of the element onto the geometry; tetra mesh, which generates tetrahedral elements from a solid model of the object geometry; voxel mesh which builds cubic 8-node elements directly from CT images; and hexa mesh that automatically generated hexahedral elements from a surface definition of the femur geometry. The various methods were tested against two reference models: a simplified geometric model and a proximal femur model. The first model was useful to assess the inherent accuracy of the meshes created by the AMG methods, since an analytical solution was available for the elastic problem of the simplified geometric model. The femur model was used to test the AMG methods in a more realistic condition. The femoral geometry was derived from a reference model (the "standardized femur") and the finite element analyses predictions were compared to experimental measurements. All methods were evaluated in terms of human and computer effort needed to carry out the complete analysis, and in terms of accuracy. The comparison demonstrated that each tested method deserves attention and may be the best for specific situations. The mapped AMG method requires a significant human effort but is very accurate and it allows a tight control of the mesh structure. The tetra AMG method requires a solid model of the object to be analysed but is widely available and accurate. The hexa AMG method requires a significant computer effort but can also be used on polygonal models and is very accurate. The voxel AMG method requires a huge number of elements to reach an accuracy comparable to that of the other methods, but it does not require any pre-processing of the CT dataset to extract the geometry and in some cases may be the only viable solution.},

In the proposed technique, the optimal scanning sequence is searched by minimizing the overall reconstruction error of the bone density distribution, predicted by linear interpolation between the slices selected, with respect to the true 2D distribution. The technique, based on an iterative discard-insert-exchange optimization method, has been tested on both a composite and a human femur CT dataset consisting of about 450 slices. For the composite femur, the 3D root mean square reconstruction error obtained with 50 slices by a radiological protocol was equal to 12.6 grey levels, on a 0-255 range, decreasing to 6.1 for the 2D-optimized protocol. Analogously, for the human femur 11.9 and 9.6 grey levels were found respectively. The procedure was validated by comparison with 3D optimization which gave only slightly lower errors, 5.7 and 9.1 grey levels respectively. It is concluded that 2D-optimization provides good sub-optimal scanning protocol for 3D bone reconstruction},

In a recent study a hexahedral mesh generator based on a grid projection algorithm was found very effective in terms of accuracy and automation. However, so far the use of this method has been documented only on data collected in vitro and only for long bones. The present study was aimed at verifying if this method represents a procedure for the generation of finite element models of human bones from data collected in vivo, robust, accurate, automatic and general enough to be used in clinical studies. Robustness, automation and numerical accuracy of the proposed method were assessed on five femoral CT data sets of patients affected by various pathologies. The generality of the method was verified by processing a femur, an ileum, a phalanx, a proximal femur reconstruction, and the micro-CT of a small sample of spongy bone. The method was found robust enough to cope with the variability of the five femurs, producing meshes with a numerical accuracy and a computational weight comparable to those found in vitro. Even when the method was used to process the other bones the levels of mesh conditioning remained within acceptable limits. Thus, it may be concluded that the method presents a generality sufficient to cope with almost any orthopaedic application.},

DESIGN: A finite element model was used to predict the bone-implant micromotion induced by stair-climbing joint loads for various thickness of non-bearing tissue fully encapsulating the implant. BACKGROUND: The results of a few published studies give indications on the amount of bone-implant relative micromotion that is required to initiate the fibrous differentiation. On the contrary, very little is known on the effect of mechanically non-bearing regions at the interface on the stability of the implant. METHODS: A new modelling strategy was adopted, which allows the simulation of soft tissues layers down to 10 microm of thickness. This technique was used in combination with an accurate and extensively validated finite element model to investigate for an anatomical cementless stem design the effect of the thickness of the soft tissues layer on the induced micro-movements. RESULTS: The stability of the implant was found extremely sensitive to the presence of soft tissue. Soft tissue layers of 300 microm were found sufficient to compromise the osseointegration on most of the stem surface. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the hypothesis that even thin layers of soft tissue may create micro-movements large enough to activate adverse biological effects. RELEVANCE: Interface layers of soft tissue too thin to be detected by a radiographic control may be sufficient to compromise the mechanical stability of cementless implants.},

	abstract = {Primary stability is recognised as an important determinant in the aseptic loosening failure process of cementless implants. An accurate evaluation of the bone-implant relative micromotion is becoming important both in pre-clinical and clinical studies. If the biological threshold for micro-movements is in the range 100-200 micrometer then, in order to be discriminative, any method used to evaluate the primary stability should have an accuracy of 10-20 micrometer or better. Additionally, such method should also be able to report the relative micromotion at each point of the interface. None of the available experimental methods satisfies both requirements. Aim of the present study is to verify if any of the current finite element modelling techniques is sufficiently accurate in predicting the primary stability of a cementless prosthesis to be used to decide whether the micromotion may or may not jeopardise the implant osseointegration. The primary stability of an anatomic cementless stem, as measured in vitro, was used as a benchmark problem to comparatively evaluate different contact modelling techniques. Frictionless contact, frictional contact and press-fitted frictional contact conditions were modelled using alternatively node-to-node, node-to-face and face-to-face contact elements. The model based on face-to-face contact elements accounting for frictional contact and initial press-fit was able to predict the micromotion measured experimentally with an average (RMS) error of 10 micrometer and a peak error of 14 micrometer. All the other models presented errors higher than 20 micrometer assumed in the present study as an accuracy threshold.},

A purely biomechanical model of osseo-integration has been developed, formulated as a rule-based adaptation scheme. Due to its complexity, the problem was divided into three steps: preliminary implementation of the model (proof of concept); implementation of the complete model and investigation of the model solution; and model validation. The paper describes the first of these three steps. The model was implemented as a discrete-states machine, and the few parameters required were derived from the literature. It was then applied to a real clinical case. The study was conducted using the frictional contact finite element model of a human femur implanted with a cementless anatomical stem. A stable solution was achieved after between three and 15 iterations for all initial positions considered. Similar initial conditions yielded similar final configurations. The model predicted all initial configurations, with the exception of a partial osseo-integration, ranging between 62\% (distal fit) and 78\% (proximal fit) of the viable interface. This is in good agreement with the values reported in the literature that never exceed 75\%, even in the best conditions, and report better clinical results for proximal fit.

	abstract = {This technical note describes a new software environment (HIPCOM design environment, HIDE) for the design of custom-made total hip replacements. These devices are frequently designed using general-purpose mechanical computer-aided design (CAD) programs using a set of bone contours extracted from the computer tomography (CT) images as anatomical reference. On the contrary, the HIDE system was developed to let the operator directly design the stem shape onto the CT images in a single-step operation. The operator can directly import CT data in DICOM format or use special functions to reconvert to a digital stack, the CT images printed on a radiological film. Once the stack of CT images is loaded, the operator can design the implant shape by imposing control sections directly on the CT images. The interpolation of these control sections produces the basic 3D shape of the custom-made stem. The shape is then exported to the CAD-computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) program to refine the design and to generate the part program to manufacture the implant with a CNC tooling machine. Using HIDE, the duration of design steps it affected was reduced by more than 50\% with respect to the standard method in use at the manufacturer site. HIDE also improved the accuracy and the repeatability of the whole procedure. The learning curve became flat after only ten cases. These good results were achieved because of the integration of the vectorial description of the prosthetic component with the raster description of the CT data that allowed the designer to use all details available in the CT images.},

	abstract = {A new procedure for the automatic generation of finite element meshes of bone segments from computed tomography (CT) data sets is described. The new method allows a direct automatic generation from the CT data and produces a very accurate unstructured hexahedral mesh. The accuracy of the method was established using the CT images of an artificial femur showing range of attenuation values comparable to those of a human femur. To establish the optimal values for the parameters controlling the mesh a sensitivity analysis was carried out using mesh-conditioning indicators. Some of the best meshes, with increasing levels of refinement, were used to analyse the stresses induced in the proximal femur by single leg stance posture. The accuracy of the meshes was evaluated using an implicit a posteriori residual-based error estimates. The number of elements with stress residuals larger than 10\% of the peak stress was 7.8\% using the coarsest mesh and only 1.8\% with the finest mesh. The proposed method has been proved able to conjugate full automation with high-quality finite element meshes. The stress predictions obtained using these hexahedral-only meshes have been more accurate than those obtained by any other automatic mesh generation algorithm. Once properly integrated in an easy-to-use application, the described method could finally make feasible many clinical applications of finite element analysis.},

Subsidence and lift-off of the tibial plate from its bony bed was recorded for each implant, using linear variable differential transformers. The greatest degree of mechanical stability was observed with the AMK design, which is secured to the bone bed using four peripherally placed 6.5-mm cancellous screws. No motion in excess of 100 micron was observed. The central-stemmed Whiteside design and the cortical screw fixated Miller-Galante designs provided slightly less stability, each demonstrating approximately 200 micron of lift-off on the unweighted side.

	volume = {31},
	abstract = {Until recently, Roentgen Stereophotogrammetric Analysis (RSA) required the manual definition of all markers using a high-resolution measurement table. To automate this tedious and time-consuming process and to eliminate observer variabilities, an analytical software package has been developed and validated for the detection, identification, and matching of markers in RSA radiographs. The digital analysis procedure consisted of the following steps: (1) the detection of markers using a variant of the Hough circle-finder technique; (2) the identification and labeling of the detected markers; (3) the reconstruction of the three-dimensional position of the bone markers and the prosthetic markers; and (4) the computation of micromotion. To assess the influence of film digitization, the measurements obtained from nine phantom radiographs using two different film scanners were compared with the results obtained by manual processing. All markers in the phantom radiographs were automatically detected and correctly labeled. The best results were obtained with a Vidar VXR-12 CCD scanner, for which the measurement errors were comparable to the errors associated with the manual approach. To assess the in vivo reproducibility, 30 patient radiographs were analyzed twice with the manual as well as with the automated procedure. Approximately, 85\% of all calibration markers and bone markers were automatically detected and correctly matched. The calibration errors and the rigid-body errors show that the accuracy of the automated procedure is comparable to the accuracy of the manual procedure. The rigid-body errors had comparable mean values for both techniques: 0.05 mm for the tibia and 0.06 mm for the prosthesis. The reproducibility of the automated procedure showed to be slightly better than that of the manual procedure. The maximum errors in the computed translation and rotation of the tibial component were 0.11 mm and 0.24, compared to 0.13 mm and 0.27 for the manual RSA procedure. The total processing time is less than 10 min per radiograph, including interactive corrections, compared to approximately 1 h for the manual approach. In conclusion, a new and widely applicable, computer-assisted technique has become available to detect, identify, and match markers in RSA radiographs and to assess the micromotion of endoprostheses. This new technique will be used in our clinic for our hip, knee, and elbow studies.},

	abstract = {Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) is an established diagnostic method for assessment of bone mineral density in the diagnosis of osteoporosis. However, the capacity of structural parameters of cancellous bone measured by high-resolution computed tomography remains to be explored. In 33 patients, bone mineral density (BMD) of the proximal femur was measured in vitro by pQCT using cylindrical biopsies from the intertrochanteric region harvested before the implantation of an artificial hip joint. By digital image analysis of CT scans, parameters derived from histomorphometry describing the microarchitecture of cancellous bone were measured. The biopsies were also loaded to failure by an uniaxial compression test to determine the biomechanical parameters, Young's modulus, strength, and maximum energy absorption (E(max)). Strong correlations were found for BMD vs. mechanical parameters (r = 0.73 for Young's modulus, r = 0.82 for strength, and r = 0.79 for E(max); p {\textless} 0.001, n = 29). The morphological parameters, bone volume per trabecular volume (BV/TV), apparent trabecular thickness (app.Tb.Th), apparent trabecular separation (app.Tb.Sp), and trabecular number (Tb.N), correlated significantly with all mechanical parameters. The combination of morphological parameters with BMD in a multivariate regression model led to an overall, but only moderate, increase in R(2) in all cases. Our data confirm the high predictive value of BMD for the mechanical competence of cancellous bone of the intertrochanteric region. However, quantification of cancellous bone structure by image analysis of CT scans may provide additional qualitative information for the analysis of bone strength.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the load transfer patterns of femurs in the intact, immediate post-operative and long-term (remodelled) post-operative implanted conditions for Lubinus SPII and Muller-Curved cemented hip prostheses, and to examine to what extent remodelling may influence the long-term outcome. DESIGN: Experimental and finite element (FE) methods were applied to composite femurs under loads representing the heel-strike phase of gait, determining cortical bone and cement strains for the different femur conditions. BACKGROUND: The authors previously developed protocols to measure bone and cement strains, and to produce remodelled femur specimens, yet these have not been applied together to compare strain patterns of different femur conditions. The Lubinus SPII is clinically more successful than the Muller-Curved stem, with failure mainly due to aseptic loosening. METHODS: Cortical bone strains were determined in intact femurs. Six femurs each were implanted with the two stem types and cortical bone and cement strains were measured. Bone remodelling was recreated using a validated CAD-CAM procedure to remove a layer of proximal cortical bone, replicating a typical scenario found in stable clinical retrievals. Strains were remeasured. FE methods were used to compliment the experiments. RESULTS: Stress shielding was reduced with remodelling, though bone strains did not return to their intact values, particularly around the calcar. Cement strains increased with remodelling. Differences occurred between the two stems; the Muller-Curved produced a more severe strain transition. CONCLUSIONS: Procedures were successfully combined together to investigate in vitro the performance of two cemented stems, in immediate and long-term post-operative conditions. The increase of cement strains with remodelling is a potential indicator for in vivo cement failure. RELEVANCE: The consequences of femoral bone remodelling on the long-term success of joint replacements are not well understood, where remodelling may lead to increased bone and cement stresses.},

	volume = {42},
	abstract = {Because many osteoporotic fractures occur during a fall, understanding the effect of off-axis loads on initiation and propagation of microdamage in trabecular bone should provide further insight into the biomechanics of age-related fractures. Fourteen on-axis cylindrical specimens were prepared from 12 bovine tibiae. Fluorescent stains were used to label the microdamage due to a sequence of compressive and torsional damaging loads. The mean decrease in Young's modulus was over four times greater than that in the shear modulus after the compressive overload, while there was no difference between the decrease in the axial and torsional stiffnesses after the torsional overload. The total microcrack density due to compression was uniform across the radius of the cylindrical specimens, while the mean density of microcracks due to torsional overloading increased from the axis of the cylindrical specimen to the circumference. The high density of microcracks near the axis of the specimen following torsional overloading was unexpected because of the low strains. Nearly 40\% of the microcracks due to torsion propagated from pre-existing microcracks caused by axial compression, indicating that existing microcracks may extend at relatively low strain if the loading mode changes. The propagating microcracks were, on average, longer than the initiating microcracks due to either compressive or torsional loading. Damage due to axial compression appears to increase the susceptibility of trabecular bone to damage propagation during subsequent torsional loads, but it has little effect on the elastic properties in shear.},

	abstract = {A dose-response relationship has been shown between loading frequency and cortical bone adaptation for frequencies of up to 10 Hz, and is presumed to persist with further increases in frequency. Studies herein aimed to investigate cortical bone adaptation to loading frequencies of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 30 Hz. Two studies were performed in adult C57BL/6 mice using the ulna axial compression-loading model. In the first study, the histomorphometric response of the ulna was studied when loaded for 120 cycles day(-1) for 3 days at one of the five frequencies and one of two load magnitudes (1.5 or 2.0 N). In the second study, the changes in ulna geometry and mechanical properties were studied following loading for 5 min day(-1), 3 days week(-1) for 4 weeks at one of the five frequencies and one of two load magnitudes (1.0 or 1.6 N). Preliminary strain gauge measurements showed that frequency had no effect on mechanical strain per unit load. In study 1, loading frequency significantly influenced bone adaptation when loading at 2.0 N, with loading at 10 Hz resulting in significantly greater adaptation than with loading at other frequencies. In study 2, loading frequency significantly influenced the change in geometry when loading at 1.6 N, with loading at 5, 10 or 30 Hz resulting in significantly greater change than with loading at 1 Hz. Loading at 5 Hz also resulted in significantly greater change than with loading at 20 Hz. No frequency effect was found on any of the mechanical properties at either load. Overall, we found cortical bone adaptation to mechanical loading to increase with increasing loading frequency up to 5-10 Hz and to plateau with frequencies beyond 10 Hz. The mechanism for this nonlinear frequency response is not known; however, based on strain gauge measurements, we do not believe it resulted from dampening associated with high frequency loading through the flexed carpal joint. The obtained findings may relate to the mechanism of mechanotransduction within the bone. This requires further investigation.},

	abstract = {The process of adaptive bone remodeling can be described mathematically and simulated in a computer model, integrated with the finite element method. In the model discussed here, cortical and trabecular bone are described as continuous materials with variable density. The remodeling rule applied to simulate the remodeling process in each element individually is, in fact, an objective function for an optimization process, relative to the external load. Its purpose is to obtain a constant, preset value for the strain energy per unit bone mass, by adapting the density. If an element in the structure cannot achieve that, it either turns to its maximal density (cortical bone) or resorbs completely. It is found that the solution obtained in generally a discontinuous patchwork. For a two-dimensional proximal femur model this patchwork shows a good resemblance with the density distribution of a real proximal femur. It is shown that the discontinuous end configuration is dictated by the nature of the differential equations describing the remodeling process. This process can be considered as a nonlinear dynamical system with many degrees of freedom, which behaves divergent relative to the objective, leading to many possible solutions. The precise solution is dependent on the parameters in the remodeling rule, the load and the initial conditions. The feedback mechanism in the process is self-enhancing, denser bone attracts more strain energy, whereby the bone becomes even more dense. It is suggested that this positive feedback of the attractor state (the strain energy field) creates order in the end configuration. In addition, the process ensures that the discontinuous end configuration is a structure with a relatively low mass, perhaps a minimal-mass structure, although this is no explicit objective in the optimization process. It is hypothesized that trabecular bone is a chaotically ordered structure which can be considered as a fractal with characteristics of optimal mechanical resistance and minimal mass, of which the actual morphology depends on the local (internal) loading characteristics, the sensor-cell density and the degree of mineralization.},

	abstract = {Connective soft tissues at the interface between implants and bone, such as in human joint replacements, can endanger the stability of the implant fixation. The potential of an implant to generate interface bone resorption and form soft tissue depends on many variables, including mechanical ones. These mechanical factors can be expressed in terms of relative motions between bone and implant at the interface or deformation of the interfacial material. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if interface debonding and subsequent relative interface motions can be responsible for interface degradation and soft tissue interposition as seen in experiments and clinical results. A finite element computer program was augmented with a mathematical description of interface debonding, dependent on interface stress criteria, and soft tissue interface interposition, dependent on relative interface motions. Three simplified models of orthopaedic implants were constructed: a cortical bone screw for fracture fixation plates, a femoral resurfacing prosthesis and a straight stem model, cemented in a bone. The predicted computer configurations were compared with clinical observations. The computer results showed how interface disruption and fibrous tissue interposition interrelate and possibly enhance each other, whereby a progressive development of the soft tissue layer can occur. Around the cortical bone screw, the predicted resorption patterns were relatively large directly under the screw head and showed a pivot point in the opposite cortex. The resurfacing cup model predicted some fibrous tissue formation under the medial and lateral cup rim, whereby the medial layer developed first because of higher initial interface stresses. The straight stem model predicted initial interface failure at the proximal parts. After proximal resorption and fibrous tissue interposition, the medial interface was completely disrupted and developed an interface layer. The distal and mid lateral side maintained within the strength criterion. Although the applied models were relatively simple, the results showed reasonable qualitative agreement with resorption patterns found in clinical studies concerning bone screws and the resurfacing cup. The hypothesis that interface debonding and subsequent relative (micro)motions could be responsible for bone resorption and fibrous tissue propagation is thereby sustained by the results.},

	abstract = {Severe loss of bone related to stress-shielding is one problem threatening the long-term integrity of noncemented total hip arthroplasty. It is widely accepted that this phenomenon is caused by adaptive bone remodeling according to Wolff's law. Recently, quantitative bone-remodeling theories have been proposed, suitable for use in computer-simulation models in combination with finite-element codes, which can be applied to simulate the long-term effect of the remodeling process. In the present paper, the results of such a computer simulation are compared with those in an animal experiment. A three-dimensional finite-element model was constructed from an animal experimental configuration concerning the implantation of a fully coated femoral hip prosthesis in dogs. The simulation results of the adaptive bone-remodeling process (geometric adaptations at the periosteal surface and density adaptations within the cancellous bone) were compared with cross-sectional measurements of the canine femurs after 2 years of follow-up. The detailed comparison showed that long-term changes in the morphology of bone around femoral components of total hip replacements can be fully explained with the present quantitative adaptive bone-remodeling theory.},

A clinical assessment of pain and a roentgenographic assessment of patterns of proximal femoral hypertrophy were made in 105 patients. Intraoperative evaluations of the distal stem fit were performed so that a tight distal fit was ensured in 67 patients. Thirty-eight patients who did not have intraoperative sizing were determined roentgenographically to have a loose distal fit. Pain was significantly more likely to occur in those patients with a loose distal fit (20 of 38) than in those with a tight distal fit (two of 67). Collar seating was associated with hypertrophy under the seated portion of the collar in all cases, and failure to seat the collar was associated with recession and rounding of the upper femoral cortical edge. Distal hypertrophy occurred in 24 of the 67 hips with a tight distal fit, and a tight distal fit did not prevent proximal hypertrophy. It was concluded that a tight distal fit is associated with more complete pain relief in cementless total hip arthroplasty and that a tight distal fit of a cylindrical stem does not prevent proximal load bearing.},

(b) Are the tensile properties strain-rate dependent? (c) Does the growth plate fracture through any preferred zone in tension? (d) Are the tensile properties of the bovine growth plate a function of age? (e) Are thicker growth plates weaker in tension? (f) Are the tensile properties of the bovine growth plate comparable to those of a child's? We compared bone-cartilage-bone specimens (0.5 x 2.5 mm2 in cross-section) from the lateral, central and medial regions of the proximal tibial growth plates of 12- to 18-month heifers. 70 specimens were tested to failure in tension at 0.0004, 0.004 and 0.04 mm/s. Tensile strength and tangent modulus were 33\% and 25\% greater, respectively, on the lateral side compared with the medial, and both were increased at the higher strain rates. We found no difference in the ultimate strains by region or strain rate. Thicker growth plates were weaker. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a three-dimensional fracture pattern extending from the upper columnar into the reserve zone. Bundles of intact chondrons remained intact, but only on the metaphyseal side, having been torn from an interterritorial matrix which remained mostly on the epiphyseal side of the fracture. We compared 21 specimens of 12- to 18-month and 19 specimens of 5-month calves from similar regions of the proximal tibia. These were tested to failure in tension at 0.004 mm/s. The older bovine growth plate was 25\% thinner, 34\% stronger and failed at 65\% greater strain. For comparison, we tested eight samples from the femoral capital growth plate of two cerebral palsy patients.

	abstract = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifactorial disease, associated with articular cartilage degeneration and eventually joint destruction. The phases of the disease have been described in detail, and mechanical factors play an important role in the initiation of OA, but many questions remain about its etiology. Swelling of cartilage, one of the earliest signs of damage, is proportional to the amount of collagen damage. This strongly suggests that damage to the collagen network is an early event in cartilage degeneration. The goal of this study was to determine the mechanical cause of early collagen damage in articular cartilage after mechanical overloading. Both the shear strain along the fibrils and the maximum fibril strains were evaluated as possible candidates for causing collagen damage. This evaluation was done by comparing the locations of maximum shear and tensile strains with the locations of initial collagen damage after mechanical overloading in bovine explants as found using antibodies directed against denatured type II collagen (Col2-3/4M). Collagen damage could be initiated by excessive shear strains along the collagen fibrils, and by excessive fibrils strains. The locations of collagen damage after mechanical overloading were highly dependent on the cartilage thickness, with thinner cartilage being more susceptible to damage than thicker samples.},

The posterior stabilized prosthesis with the polyethylene tibia demonstrated six failures including two loose tibial components, two loose femoral components, and one supracondylar femur fracture. The posterior stabilized prosthesis with the metal-backed tibial component was associated with seven failures including six infections (three early and three late) and one femoral loosening. No metal-backed tibial components have been revised for loosening. The overall failure rate in this series was 1.7\% for all prostheses. The incidence of tibial loosening was 0.53\% with an average time to failure of 4.7 years. The incidence of femoral loosening was 0.35\% with an average time to failure of 2.0 years. Tibial loosening was related to error in technique: postoperative varus tibiofemoral alignment, varus tibial component position, and excessive tibial resection. The overall infection rate was 0.63\% for all total knee arthroplasties, and all were secondary to gram-positive organisms. Presently, the posterior stabilized prosthesis with a metal-backed tibia is the authors' implant of choice. Technical error and infection are the major causes of failure.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: In a meta-analysis of the literature we evaluated the present knowledge of the material properties of cortical and cancellous bone to answer the question whether the available data are sufficient to realize anisotropic finite element (FE)-models of the proximal femur. MATERIAL AND METHOD: All studies that met the following criteria were analyzed: Young's modulus, tensile, compressive and torsional strengths, Poisson's ratio, the shear modulus and the viscoelastic properties had to be determined experimentally. The experiments had to be carried out in a moist environment and at room temperature with freshly removed and untreated human cadaverous femurs. All material properties had to be determined in defined load directions (axial, transverse) and should have been correlated to apparent density (g/cm(3)), reflecting the individually variable and age-dependent changes of bone material properties. RESULTS: Differences in Young's modulus of cortical [cancellous] bone at a rate of between 33\% (58\%) (at low apparent density) and 62\% (80\%) (at high apparent density), are higher in the axial than in the transverse load direction. Similar results have been seen for the compressive strength of femoral bone. For the tensile and torsional strengths, Poisson's ratio and the shear modulus, only ultimate values have been found without a correlation to apparent density. For the viscoelastic behaviour of bone only data of cortical bone and in axial load direction have been described up to now. CONCLUSIONS: Anisotropic FE-models of the femur could be realized for most part with the summarized material properties of bone if characterized by apparent density and load directions. Because several mechanical properties have not been correlated to these main criteria, further experimental investigations will be necessary in future.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The status of periprosthetic bone stock is an important concern when revision total hip arthroplasty is undertaken. Remodeling of periprosthetic femoral bone after total hip arthroplasty has been studied extensively, and the phenomenon of femoral stress-shielding has been well characterized. Finite element analysis and computer-simulated remodeling theory have predicted that retroacetabular bone-mineral density decreases after total hip arthroplasty; however, remodeling of periprosthetic pelvic bone in this setting has yet to be well defined. This study was conducted to evaluate the short-term natural history of periacetabular bone-mineral density following primary total hip arthroplasty. METHODS: Periacetabular bone-mineral density was studied prospectively in a group of twenty-six patients who underwent primary hybrid total hip arthroplasty for the treatment of advanced osteoarthritis. Density within the central part of the ilium (directly cephalad to a press-fit acetabular component) was assessed with serial quantitative computed tomography. Baseline density was measured within the first five days following the total hip arthroplasty. Ipsilateral density measurements were repeated at an average of 1.28 years postoperatively. Density values at corresponding levels of the contralateral ilium were obtained at both time-points in all patients to serve as internal controls. RESULTS: Bone-mineral density decreased significantly (p{\textless} or =0.001) between the two time-points on the side of the operation. The mean absolute magnitude of the interval density reduction (75 mg/cc) was greatest immediately adjacent to the implant (p{\textless}0.001), but it was also significantly reduced (by 35 mg/cc) at a distance of 10 mm cephalad to the implant (p = 0.001). Relative declines in mean density ranged from 33\% to 20\% of the baseline values. No focal bone resorption (osteolysis) was detected at the time of this short-term follow-up study. With the numbers available, no significant interval alteration in bone-mineral density was found on the untreated (internal control) side (p{\textgreater} or =0.07). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the observed decline in bone-mineral density represents a remodeling response to an altered stress pattern within the pelvis that was induced by the presence of the acetabular implant. This finding corroborates the predictions of finite element analysis and computer-simulated remodeling theory. It remains to be seen whether this trend of atrophy of retroacetabular bone stock will continue with longer follow-up or will ultimately affect the long-term stability of press-fit acetabular components.},

	abstract = {Trabecular architecture is considered important in osteoporosis and has been quantified by a variety of mean parameters characteristic of a whole specimen. Variations within a specimen, however, have been mostly ignored. In this study, the theoretical effects of these intraspecimen variations in architecture on predicted mechanical properties were investigated through a three-dimensional finite element parameter study that simulated variations in trabecular thickness in a controlled manner. An irregularly spaced lattice of different sized rods was used to simulate trabecular bone in three distinct volume fraction ranges, representing young, middle-aged, and elderly vertebral bone. Beta distributions (a type of non-normal distribution) of trabecular thickness with coefficients of variation of either 25\%, 40\%, or 55\% were applied to the rods in each model, and 225 simulations of uniaxial compression tests were performed to obtain modulus values. Percent modulus reductions of 22\% and 43\% were predicted when the intraspecimen coefficient of variation in trabecular thickness was increased from 25\% to 40\% and from 25\% to 55\%, respectively, for models of equal volume fraction. Furthermore, this trend was predicted to be independent of volume fraction. We conclude, therefore, that consideration of the intraspecimen trabecular thickness variation in conjunction with volume fraction may improve the ability to predict trabecular modulus compared with use of volume fraction alone. Further, the model suggests that if age, disease, or drug treatments increase trabecular thickness variation, this may be detrimental to mechanical properties.},

	abstract = {Compared to trabecular microfracture, the biomechanical consequences of the morphologically more subtle trabecular microdamage are unclear but potentially important because of its higher incidence. A generic three-dimensional finite element model of the trabecular bone microstructure was used to investigate the relative biomechanical roles of these damage categories on reloading elastic modulus after simulated overloads to various strain levels. Microfractures of individual trabeculae were modeled using a maximum fracture strain criterion, for three values of fracture strain (2\%, 8\%, and 35\%). Microdamage within the trabeculae was modeled using a strain-based modulus reduction rule based on cortical bone behavior. When combining the effects of both microdamage and microfracture, the model predicted reductions in apparent modulus upon reloading of over 60\% at an applied apparent strain of 2\%, in excellent agreement with previously reported experimental data. According to the model, up to 80\% of the trabeculae developed microdamage at 2\% apparent strain, and between 2\% and 10\% of the trabeculae were fractured, depending on which fracture strain was assumed. If microdamage could not occur but microfracture could, good agreement with the experimental data only resulted if the trabecular hard tissue had a fracture strain of 2\%. However, a high number of fractures (10\% of the trabeculae) would need to occur for this case, and this has not been observed in published damage morphology studies. We conclude therefore that if the damage behavior of trabecular hard tissue is similar to that of cortical bone, then extensive microdamage is primarily responsible for the large loss in apparent mechanical properties that can occur with overloading of trabecular bone.},

	abstract = {The prediction of patient-specific proximal femur mechanical response to various load conditions is of major clinical importance in orthopaedics. This paper presents a novel, empirically validated high-order finite element method (FEM) for simulating the bone response to loads. A model of the bone geometry was constructed from a quantitative computerized tomography (QCT) scan using smooth surfaces for both the cortical and trabecular regions. Inhomogeneous isotropic elastic properties were assigned to the finite element model using distinct continuous spatial fields for each region. The Young's modulus was represented as a continuous function computed by a least mean squares method. p-FEMs were used to bound the simulation numerical error and to quantify the modeling assumptions. We validated the FE results with in-vitro experiments on a fresh-frozen femur loaded by a quasi-static force of up to 1500 N at four different angles. We measured the vertical displacement and strains at various locations and investigated the sensitivity of the simulation. Good agreement was found for the displacements, and a fair agreement found in the measured strain in some of the locations. The presented study is a first step toward a reliable p-FEM simulation of human femurs based on QCT data for clinical computer aided decision making.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanical response of patient-specific bone to various load conditions is of major clinical importance in orthopedics. Herein we enhance the methods presented in Yosibash et al. [2007. A CT-based high-order finite element analysis of the human proximal femur compared to in-vitro experiments. ASME Journal of Biomechanical Engineering 129(3), 297-309.] for the reliable simulations of the human proximal femur by high-order finite elements (FEs) and validate the simulations by experimental observations. METHOD OF APPROACH: A fresh-frozen human femur was scanned by quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and thereafter loaded (in vitro experiments) by a quasi-static force of up to 1250 N. QCT scans were manipulated to generate a high-order FE bone model with distinct cortical and trabecular regions having inhomogeneous isotropic elastic properties with Young's modulus represented by continuous spatial functions. Sensitivity analyses were performed to quantify parameters that mostly influence the mechanical response. FE results were compared to displacements and strains measured in the experiments. RESULTS: Young moduli correlated to QCT Hounsfield Units by relations in Keyak and Falkinstein [2003. Comparison of in situ and in vitro CT scan-based finite element model predictions of proximal femoral fracture load. Medical Engineering and Physics 25, 781-787.] were found to provide predictions that match the experimental results closely. Excellent agreement was found for both the displacements and strains. The presented study demonstrates that reliable and validated high-order patient-specific FE simulations of human femurs based on QCT data are achievable for clinical computer-aided decision making.},

	abstract = {Digital computed tomographic (CT) data are widely used in three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of bone geometry and density features for 3-D) modeling purposes. During in vivo CT data acquisition the number of scans must be limited in order to protect patients from the risks related to X-ray absorption. Aim of this work is to automatically define, given a finite number of CT slices, the scanning plan which returns the optimal 3-D) reconstruction of a bone segment from in vivo acquired CT images. An optimization algorithm based on a Discard-Insert-Exchange technique has been developed. In the proposed method the optimal scanning sequence is searched by minimizing the overall reconstruction error of a two-dimensional (2-D) prescanning image: an anterior-posterior (AP) X-ray projection of the bone segment. This approach has been validated in vitro on three different femurs. The 3-D reconstruction errors obtained through the optimization of the scanning plan on the 2-D) prescanning images and on the corresponding 3-D data sets have been compared. Two-dimensional and 3-D data sets have been reconstructed by linear interpolation along the longitudinal axis. Results show that direct 3-D optimization yields root mean square reconstruction errors which are only 4\%-7\% lower than the 2-D-optimized plan, thus proving that 2-D-optimization provides a good suboptimal scanning plan for 3-D reconstruction. Further on, 3-D reconstruction errors given by the optimized scanning plan and a standard radiological protocol for long bones have been compared. Results show that the optimized plan yields 20\%-50\% lower 3-D reconstruction errors.},

The aim of this study was to measure the artifactual errors produced in the CT images of a cortical bone and water equivalent materials phantom by a titanium alloy hip joint prosthetic stem. The image data have been analyzed and the average error over the 10 mm thick cortical bone surrounding the implant evaluated. Subsequently the mean error on each pixel crown surrounding the implant was assessed. The effect of this local error on the material properties assessment of a biomechanical model of the bone-implant complex was estimated. An apparent increase in bone density of approximately 3\% was observed in the cortical bone region. The effect of the titanium implant, however, is confined within a 4-8 pixels (1.2-2.4 mm) distance from the prosthetic implant. Even if the local perturbation is very difficult to correct, some possibilities to reduce the effect of the artifactual errors on the material properties assignment to a biomechanical model are proposed},

These artifacts can degrade the capabilities of CT images to provide accurate information about the geometry and mineral density of bone structures. The aim of this work was to investigate the possibility of developing finite element models (FEM) of the human femur after hip joint arthroplasty using CT images acquired directly after surgery. The capability of modern CT scanners to accurately reconstruct the cross-section geometry of titanium alloy hip joint prosthetic stems was primarily investigated. A new measuring procedure dealing with the geometry of real stems was developed and its accuracy assessed. Secondly, the artifacts generated by a prosthetic stem on the radiological density of the bone were analysed, and their effects on the assessment of FEM material properties were evaluated. Results showed that CT images provide accurate information on metal stem geometry. An average error of 0.45 mm was estimated in the reconstruction of stem cross-section geometry. Concerning bone density estimation around the implant, it was observed that the effect of metal artifacts on tissue density becomes zero at a distance of 2 mm from the implant.},

Using a Fourier expansion in spherical harmonics, the orientation distribution function of a positive, radially symmetric microstructural property is approximated by a scalar and a symmetric, traceless second rank tensor. Following this approximation, a general expression of the elastic free energy potential is derived from representation theorems for anisotropic scalar functions. Based on a homogeneity assumption for the elastic constitutive law with respect to the microstructural property, a particular elasticity model is developed that involves three independent constants beside the fabric tensors. Strict positive definiteness of the corresponding elasticity tensor is ensured under explicit conditions on the independent constants for arbitrary fabric tensors.},

	abstract = {Improved preventive and therapeutic strategies for skeletal diseases such as osteoporosis rely on a better understanding of the mechanical properties of trabecular bone and their influence on cell mediated adaptation processes. The mechanical properties of trabecular bone are determined by composition as well as structural (trabecular architecture), microstructural (trabecular packets) and nanostructural (lamellae) organization. Density is the major predictor of the mechanical properties of trabecular structures and has been extended to the concept of fabric to include architectural anisotropy and improve even further the power of prediction. Recent advances in QCT and MRI technologies allow for precise assessment of 3D trabecular architecture and the mechanical consequences of structural changes can be increasingly well quantified by the means of computational methods. While single trabeculae have been tested using various techniques with contrasting results, little is known about the intrinsic mechanical properties of trabecular bone lamellae on which these computational methods rely. For instance, water and mineral content have a significant effect on the elastic, viscous, yield and postyield properties of bone tissue. In addition, collagen fiber orientation affects the mechanics of single remodeling units. Variations in composition and organization determined by age, accumulated damage or disease may therefore reduce the mechanical integrity of trabecular bone and deserve more attention. The aim of this work was to utilize a nanoindentation technique to quantify elastic modulus and hardness of human trabecular bone lamellae.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of workspace location on joint coordination in persons with post-stroke hemiparesis when trunk motion was required to complete reaches beyond the arm's functional reach length. Seven subjects with mild right hemiparesis following a stroke and seven age and gender matched control subjects participated. Joint motions and characteristics of hand and trunk movement were measured over multiple repetitions. The variance (across trials) of joint combinations was partitioned into two components at every point in the hand's trajectory using the uncontrolled manifold approach; the first component is a measure of the extent to which equivalent joint combinations are used to control a given hand path, and reflects performance flexibility. The second component of joint variance reflects the use of non-equivalent joint combinations, which lead to hand path error. Compared to the control subjects, persons with hemiparesis demonstrated a significantly greater amount of non-equivalent joint variability related to control of the hand's path and of the hand's position relative to the trunk when reaching toward the hemiparetic side (ipsilaterally), but not when reaching to the less involved side. The relative timing of the hand and trunk was also altered when reaching ipsilaterally. The current findings support the idea that the previously proposed "arm compensatory synergy" may be deficient in subjects with hemiparesis. This deficiency may be due to one or a combination of factors: changes in central commands that are thought to set the gain of the arm compensatory synergy; a limited ability to combine shoulder abduction and elbow extension that limits the expression of an appropriately set arm compensatory synergy; or a reduction of the necessary degrees-of-freedom needed to adequately compensate for poor trunk control when reaching ipsilaterally.},

Our purpose was to determine the effect of varying foot placement on the magnitude of the Q angle. DESIGN AND SETTING: A mixed between-within, repeated-measures design was used to compare Q angles derived under static weight-bearing conditions with the feet positioned in self-selected versus standardized stance positions. SUBJECTS: Twenty healthy young-adult men and women with no history of acute injury to or chronic dysfunction of the lower limbs. MEASUREMENTS: We placed light-emitting diodes bilaterally on the left and right anterior superior iliac spines, the tibial tuberosities, and the midpoints of the patellae to bilaterally define the Q angles. An OPTOTRAK motion-measurement system was used to capture x,y coordinate data at a sampling rate of 60 Hz. These data were subsequently filtered and used to calculate the magnitude of the left and right Q angles. RESULTS: A repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed that when measured statically, Q angles differed significantly between stance positions (P {\textless}.001) and limbs (P {\textless}.05). Depending on the stance adopted, mean Q angles varied from 7.2 degrees to 12.7 degrees and 11.0 degrees to 16.1 degrees in the left and right lower limbs, respectively. Q-angle measurements taken in conjunction with the Romberg foot position most closely resembled those gathered with the feet in a self-selected stance (Pearson r = 0.86 to 0.92). CONCLUSIONS: Q-angle magnitude varies with changes in foot position, increasing or decreasing as the foot rotates internally or externally, respectively. These data demonstrate the need for a standardized foot position for Q-angle measurements.},

	abstract = {Laparoscopic techniques have gained wide acceptance because they offer a safe and less invasive alternative to open surgery. To further reduce the invasiveness of peritoneal access, the next logical step is to eliminate the incision through the abdominal wall using natural orifices as entry points. This Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) approach has the potential to replace or augment current techniques. Several research groups have cut through the stomach or colon wall (per-oral transgastric or per-anal transcolonic) to perform organ resections in animal models, and some procedures in humans have been reported anecdotally. Widespread use of these techniques will depend on providing the physician with adequate visual feedback, clear indicators of instrument location and orientation, and support in the recognition of anatomic structures. Compared with laparoscopy, successful endoscopy must accommodate several additional complexities: (1) The flexibility of the endoscope tip complicates the understanding of its distal orientation. Successful navigation inside the stomach and in the abdominal cavity generally requires two years of sub-specialty training. (2) Several surgical targets lie in a retrograde position with respect to an incision in the stomach wall. Efficient and safe access to the pancreas, gall bladder, or the kidneys requires detailed knowledge of the tip placement relative to adjacent anatomic structures. (3) Since there is limited direct access to the abdomen, iatrogenic injuries, such as the accidental cutting of an artery, will be more dangerous and difficult to manage. We present here approaches to resolving these limitations though augmented reality techniques using pre-procedure CT or MRI imaging, real time tracking and reference image registration, and display to the operating physician. As an example, the utility of image registration techniques for orientation for the gastric access puncture is discussed in detail. It is anticipated that such augmentation will make intra-cavitary interventional techniques easier to master and use in practice, and thus more likely to be widely adopted.},

	abstract = {From our experience of endoscopic surgery using the surgical robot da Vinci at our hospital, it has become clear that the lack of a sense of touch of the forceps makes meticulous operations difficult. For the development of a surgical robot that would impart a sense of touch, we investigated the appropriate knot-tying force by determining the relation between this force and wound healing in dog models. We cut and then sutured the jejenum of Beagle dogs, using a series of knot-tying forces (0.5-5.0 N). The jejenum was then removed on the 4$^{\textrm{th}}$, 7$^{\textrm{th}}$, 11$^{\textrm{th}}$ and 14$^{\textrm{th}}$ postoperative days, and the microvessel density for each force was measured to determine the appropriate knot-tying force for the jejenum. The microvessel density in the submucosa on the 7$^{\textrm{th}}$ and 11$^{\textrm{th}}$ postoperative days was significantly higher for the knot-tying force of 1.5 N than for other forces used. Thus, the results of our study suggested that a knot-tying force of 1.5 N was the most appropriate force for suturing of wounds of the jejenum. We consider that this result would be useful for the development of a surgical robot that imparts a sense of touch to the surgeon's hand.},

The basic and essential functions that such a microdevice must possess are listed and discussed in details, as well as the specific features required in the different districts of the digestive path. Active legged locomotion was selected to achieve the adequate degree of flexibility and accuracy during the capsule journey. In addition, on-board locomotion mechanisms would allow to avoid bulky external driving systems that are typical of externally actuated devices. Two different prototypes, having 4 and 8 legs respectively, are presented, evaluated and tested. In particular, the 8-leg solution achieved a speed of 6 cm/min during in vitro tests. Moreover, it demonstrated capabilities of backward locomotion, vertical locomotion and locomotion around acute bends.},

	abstract = {Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) involves a multidimensional series of tasks requiring a synthesis between visual information and the kinematics and dynamics of the surgical tools. Analysis of these sources of information is a key step in defining objective criteria for characterizing surgical performance. The Blue DRAGON is a new system for acquiring the kinematics and the dynamics of two endoscopic tools synchronized with the endoscopic view of the surgical scene. Modeling the process of MIS using a finite state model [Markov model (MM)] reveals the internal structure of the surgical task and is utilized as one of the key steps in objectively assessing surgical performance. The experimental protocol includes tying an intracorporeal knot in a MIS setup performed on an animal model (pig) by 30 surgeons at different levels of training including expert surgeons. An objective learning curve was defined based on measuring quantitative statistical distance (similarity) between MM of experts and MM of residents at different levels of training. The objective learning curve was similar to that of the subjective performance analysis. The MM proved to be a powerful and compact mathematical model for decomposing a complex task such as laparoscopic suturing. Systems like surgical robots or virtual reality simulators in which the kinematics and the dynamics of the surgical tool are inherently measured may benefit from incorporation of the proposed methodology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The limited angle of view of standard colonoscopes means that lesions can be missed. A multidirectional viewing system (OmniVision) has been developed recently and has been incorporated into the Aer-O-Scope (GI View Ltd., Ramat Gan, Israel), a disposable, self-propelling, and self-navigating colonoscope. The objectives of this study were to qualitatively assess the sensitivity of this viewing system in an ex vivo porcine polyp induction model, and to demonstrate its feasibility and safety in live pigs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the ex vivo part of the study, six red metal beads of various sizes were randomly sewn into the mucosa of an unfolded, 2-meter-long porcine colonic segment. Seven passages of the Aer-O-Scope were video-recorded separately and blindly reviewed by six experienced gastroenterologists. The sensitivity of the Aer-O-Scope to detect beads of various sizes was calculated. For the in vivo experiment, in a repeated-measure study, nine female domestic pigs were examined with the Aer-O-Scope with the OmniView optics, followed immediately by examination with standard optical colonoscopy in order to assess the integrity of the colonic mucosa. RESULTS: In the ex vivo study the sensitivity of the Aer-O-Scope was 97.6\% (CI 94.0\%-100\%) for any bead (i. e. any "polyp"). The rate of polyp detection was similar for the six endoscopists, and was consistent for all bead sizes. The average false-positive rate was 0.3\% polyps per run (SD 0.61\%). The mean time taken for the video assessment was 8.0 minutes (SD 4.0 minutes). In the in vivo experiments with the Aer-O-Scope, both the front-viewing and omnidirectional-viewing systems were functional in all cases. The colon in front of the optical capsule was well distended and a complete and meticulous inspection of the entire colonic mucosa was performed in all the pigs. There were no adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The OmniVision system allows for a highly sensitive inspection of the colonic mucosa without the need for tip manipulation. Clinical studies are warranted in order to validate these results in humans.},

New instrument platforms for endoscopic screening could be useful. The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent of colonic intubation by using a novel self-propelled, self-navigating endoscope (the Aer-O-Scope; GI View Ltd, Ramat Gan, Israel). METHODS: Twelve young healthy volunteers underwent complete bowel preparation followed by a nonsedated examination using the novel device. Each examination was followed by a standard colonoscopy for safety evaluation. Cecal intubation was confirmed by endoscopic landmarks and fluoroscopy. RESULTS: In 10 out of 12 subjects (83\%) the cecum was successfully reached, whereas in 2 cases the Aer-O-Scope advanced to the hepatic flexure. The time to complete advancement to cecum averaged 14.0 +/- 7 minutes, and the driving pressures averaged 34 +/- 2.3 milibar. Two subjects requested analgesics during the procedures (in both cases the cecum was reached). Four subjects experienced sweating and a bloating sensation that resolved spontaneously. All subjects were followed up to 48 hours and then for 30 days postprocedure, and no complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In a preliminary pilot feasibility study of this new instrument, the Aer-O-Scope effectively intubated all or most of the colon. Further clinical studies are warranted.},

The robot manipulates a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) probe to collect a series of 2 dimensional (2D) images of the prostate, which are later used to create a 3D computer model of the organ. The urologist defines the needle\&\#8217;s entry point at the perineal wall and the biopsy points within the 3D model following a biopsy protocol or otherwise. The robotic system then calculates the required trajectory of the needle. The path of the needle going into the prostate can also be simulated with the 3D model before the actual insertion. Being satisfied with the predicted outcome, the urologist configures the robot accordingly and manually pushes the mechanically guided needle into the patient to take the biopsy. Cadaveric and human trials have validated the robot\&\#8217;s needle placement error to be less than 2.5mm. Our future work includes the integration of a cancer predictive modality into the system to increase the cancer detection rate. The robotic system could also be modified to accurately place foreign bodies into the prostate, which could improve therapeutic procedures such as Brachytherapy.},

They often, however, have moving components that allow physical or analytical functions to be performed by the device. Although MEMS can be aseptically fabricated and hermetically sealed, biocompatibility of the component materials is a key issue for MEMS used in vivo. Interest in MEMS for biological applications (BioMEMS) is growing rapidly, with opportunities in areas such as biosensors, pacemakers, immunoisolation capsules, and drug delivery. The key to many of these applications lies in the leveraging of features unique to MEMS (for example, analyte sensitivity, electrical responsiveness, temporal control, and feature sizes similar to cells and organelles) for maximum impact. In this paper, we focus on how the biological integration of MEMS and other implantable devices can be improved through the application of microfabrication technology and concepts. Innovative approaches for improved physical and chemical integration of systems with the body are reviewed. An untapped potential for MEMS may lie in the area of nervous and endocrine system actuation, whereby the ability of MEMS to deliver potent drugs or hormones, combined with their precise temporal control, may provide new treatments for disorders of these systems.},

Data sources: Seven databases were used to acquire articles. The key words used to search for the relative topics published from 1996 to 2007 were \&\#8220;obsessive-compulsive disorder\&\#8221; and \&\#8220;Yale-Brown obsession-compulsion scale.\&\#8221; Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 25 studies were selected from 57 potentially relevant studies. Conclusions: The effects of treatment with clomipramine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs: fluvoxamine, sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram) proved to be similar, except for the lower adherence rate in case of clomipramine because of its side effects. An adequate drug trial involves administering an effective daily dose for a minimum of 8 weeks. An augmentation strategy proven effective for individuals refractory to monotherapy with SSRI treatment alone is the use of atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine). Implications for practice: Administration of fluvoxamine or sertraline to patients for an adequate duration is recommended as the first-line prescription for OCD, and augmentation therapy with risperidone, olanzapine, or quetiapine is recommended for refractory OCD.},

	abstract = {Regulatory methods for the measurement of particulate matter (PM) mass emissions have traditionally been gravimetric. Modern diesel engines equipped with aftertreatment systems, especially Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs), however, emit much smaller amounts of particulate matter as compared to traditional diesel engines and emit particulate matter with variable compositions. These changes have led to difficulties in measuring PM emissions rates from modern diesel engines using gravimetric methods. Issues associated with diesel PM mass measurement, such as the semi-volatile nature of PM, the interactions with components in the dilution air such as water and ammonia, and the possibility of sampling artifacts, have counteracted a singular focus on mass measurements. These inherent problems may warrant some alternative approaches to characterizing emissions, using methods related to mass and impacts of emissions that can be more accurately defined. The present study provides a comparison and relative precision of several alternative mass measurement methods employed to measure the mass emissions of particulate matter from diesel engines with low and ultra-low levels of emissions. The methods of measurement reviewed in this study include two gravimetrically based methods, a chemically reconstructed mass method, and an integrated particle size distribution (IPSD) method. The mass measurements were consistent at low emission levels but the chemical speciation and IPSD methods achieved closer agreement and were more precise at ultra-low emission levels. Although mass measurement is a NIST-traceable quantity, alternative methods may present a new paradigm that better characterizes engine emissions in an atmospherically relevant manner.},

Actuator deflection is computed based on elastic analysis of structures. To verify the validity of the model, polysilicon thermal flexure actuators have been fabricated and tested.

	abstract = {A new inchworm micromotor using new electrostatic in-plane twisting microactuators has been designed, fabricated and characterized for nano-resolution manipulators. The proposed twisting mechanism was implemented employing a pair of differential electrostatic actuators with a high stiffness in the driving direction for stable positioning. The electromechanically coupled motion of the voltageâ€“displacement relation was analyzed using a finite element method (FEM), confirming that the twisting actuator makes a tiny step movement efficiently. The proposed actuator was fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer with the device footprint of 2.2 Ã— 2.8 mm 2 , and its nano-stepping characteristics were measured by an optical interferometer consisting of an integrated micromirror and optical fiber. The fabricated inchworm motor showed a minimum step displacement of 5.2 Â± 3.8 nm (2Ïƒ) and 4.1 Â± 2.9 nm (2Ïƒ) for cyclic motion in the + y - and the âˆ’ y -directions, respectively, with the gripping voltage of 15 V and differential voltage of 1 V. As a result, the proposed inchworm micromotor could operate with a stroke of 3 Âµm and a bi-directional step displacement of less than 10 nm. The step displacement is the smallest value of in-plane-type micromotors so far, and its magnitude was controllable up to 120 nm/cycle by changing the differential voltage.},

The authors present a new real-time methodology based on linear FE analysis that is appropriate for a wide range of surgical simulation applications. A methodology is proposed that is characterized by high model resolution, low preprocessing time, unrestricted multipoint surface contact, and adjustable boundary conditions. These features make the method ideal for modeling suturing, which is an element common to almost every surgical procedure.

Performance was compared between force feedback gains of 75\% and 150\% and no force feedback. The absence of force feedback increased the average force magnitude applied to the tissue by at least 50\%, and increased the peak force magnitude by at least a factor of 2. The number of errors that damage tissue increased by over a factor 3. The rate and precision of dissection were not significantly enhanced with force feedback. We hypothesize that force feedback is helpful in this blunt dissection task because the artery is stiffer than the surrounding tissue. This mechanical contrast serves to constrain the subjects' hand from commanding inappropriate motions that generate large forces.},

In this paper a comparison study was made between electrical rotary actuators and PMs on the basis of the taualpha value. It is showed that claims which consider PMs as lighter actuators compared to the other types of actuators are not precise and are highly questionable since some factors are neglected in comparison between the weight of the actuators.},

	abstract = {Constitutive relations are fundamental to the solution of problems in continuum mechanics, and are required in the study of, for example, mechanically dominated clinical interventions involving soft biological tissues. Structural continuum constitutive models of arterial layers integrate information about the tissue morphology and therefore allow investigation of the interrelation between structure and function in response to mechanical loading. Collagen fibres are key ingredients in the structure of arteries. In the media (the middle layer of the artery wall) they are arranged in two helically distributed families with a small pitch and very little dispersion in their orientation (i.e. they are aligned quite close to the circumferential direction). By contrast, in the adventitial and intimal layers, the orientation of the collagen fibres is dispersed, as shown by polarized light microscopy of stained arterial tissue. As a result, continuum models that do not account for the dispersion are not able to capture accurately the stressâ€“strain response of these layers. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to develop a structural continuum framework that is able to represent the dispersion of the collagen fibre orientation. This then allows the development of a new hyperelastic free-energy function that is particularly suited for representing the anisotropic elastic properties of adventitial and intimal layers of arterial walls, and is a generalization of the fibre-reinforced structural model introduced by Holzapfel \& Gasser (Holzapfel \& Gasser 2001 Comput. Meth. Appl. Mech. Eng. 190, 4379â€“4403) and Holzapfel et al. (Holzapfel et al. 2000 J. Elast. 61, 1â€“48). The model incorporates an additional scalar structure parameter that characterizes the dispersed collagen orientation. An efficient finite element implementation of the model is then presented and numerical examples show that the dispersion of the orientation of collagen fibres in the adventitia of human iliac arteries has a significant effect on their mechanical response.},

The design of this snake-like unit is compared to other alternative designs that use a single flexible-backbone and wire-actuation. A unified kinematic and virtual work model is used to perform this comparison between a multi-backbone snake like unit with an equal-diameter snake-like unit using a single flexible backbone and wire actuation. The comparison is presented for several actuation redundancy resolutions that minimize the load on the flexible backbones. The results show that the multi-backbone design is superior to the alternative wire-actuated designs using a single flexible backbone. The advantages manifest in smaller required actuation forces on the backbones and, as a result, a reduced risk of buckling of the backbones and enhanced potential downsize scalability.},

In this paper we develop a new coordinate-free energy formulation that accounts for general preshaping of an arbitrary number of component tubes, and which explicitly includes both bending and torsion throughout the device. We show that previously reported models are special cases of our formulation, and then explore in detail the implications of torsional flexibility for the special case of two tubes. Experiments demonstrate that this framework is more descriptive of physical prototype behavior than previous models1 it reduces model prediction error by 82\% over the calibrated bending-only model, and 17\% over the calibrated transmissional torsion model in a set of experiments.},

New methods of preoperative imaging, that is, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography, have allowed for a better understanding of surgical pathology. Such an understanding is likely to lead to a more successful surgical experience, which certainly is the case with spine surgery with instrumentation. However, after implantation of most instrumentation, imaging is greatly impaired. Metallurgic advancements in titanium were sought to reduce postoperative imaging problems. The purpose of this study is to assess the presence and extent of artifacts seen on postoperative MRI scans in patients with titanium spinal implants. Six patients, four with degenerative spine disease and two with neoplasms, had thoracic and/or lumbar spinal fixation performed with titanium instrumentation. All patients underwent postoperative conventional MRI with the use of T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and gradient-echo sequences. The scans and individual sequences were then analyzed for image quality. A progressive and significant increase in imaging artifact related to the titanium spinal instrumentation was observed on the T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and gradient-echo sequences. Titanium spinal instruments do not allow optimal postoperative imaging on conventional MRI scanners.},

Our aim is to identify the human capabilities, in terms of penetration depth and responsiveness, in a task of pliable surface contact, where surgeons are required to adopt a specific behavior immediately after the contact. A psychophysical experiment is conducted using virtual surfaces rendered with two different force-feedback devices. The results show that impact velocity affects performance in surface contact perception. In a second experiment where different postures are used, we examine whether the previous results hold for the particular ergonomic configuration employed. The results show that posture affects performance especially in expert users. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding the interplay of human perceptual parameters in the surgical teleoperation framework.},

	abstract = {Actuators play an important role at the end-effectors of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) robots. Having local, lightweight and powerful actuators would increase dexterity of surgeons. Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuators are considered as good candidates and presented significant behaviors in producing the force needed for grasping. Most of the current MIS systems provide surgeons with visual feedback. However, in many operations this information could not help surgeons to diagnose the manipulated tissue accurately. Therefore, having force and tactile information is also necessary. In order to have this information, local sensors are needed to give force feedback. This would also help to have control over the wire tension and prevent exceeding force causing tissue damages. In this paper a novel design of forceps that uses antagonistic SMA actuators is presented. This configuration helps to increase force and speed and also eliminates the bias spring used in similar works. Moreover, this antagonistic design makes it possible to place the force sensors at the back part of the forceps instead of attaching them to the jaws which results in a smaller forceps design. To control the exerted force, analytical model of system and a force control method are also presented. This enhanced design seems to address some of the existing shortcomings of similar models and remove them effectively.},

This paper studies the concept of imposing damage thresholds on surgical instruments to avoid tissue overload. More specifically, the correlation between mechanical loading and damage in case of vascular clamping is investigated. With a computer controlled device, a high and a low clamping load were applied in vivo on the abdominal aorta of 43 rats. Samples of both loading levels were compared with zero load control samples and with samples clamped by a mosquito clamp w.r.t. functionality and histological integrity. Analysis of the samples shows that high clamping forces result in endothelial and smooth muscle cell destruction. Clamping with a mosquito clamp will cause even more damage to the elastic lamellae. Samples loaded at the lower load showed significantly less smooth muscle cell damage and a lower degree of endothelial damage. This paper is the first to statistically quantify the correlation between the degree of mechanical loading and the degree of tissue damage, thus setting the first steps towards tissue overload prevention during surgery. Future experiments will also include the effects of loading duration, recovery and patient-specificity.},

As such, there is a focus on robotic surgical solutions which are commercially available; research efforts which have not gained regulatory approval or entered clinical use are mostly omitted. The practice of robotic surgery is currently largely dominated by the da Vinci system of Intuitive Surgical (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) but other commercial players have now entered the market with surgical robotic products or are appearing in the horizon with medium and long term propositions. Surgical robotics is currently a vibrant research topic and new research directions may lead to the development of very different robotic surgical devices in the future-small, special purpose, lower cost, possibly disposable robots rather than the current large, versatile and capital expensive systems. As the trend towards minimally invasive surgery (MIS) increases, surgery becomes more technically demanding for surgeons and more challenging for medical device technologists and it is clear that surgical robotics has now an established foothold in medicine as an enabling technology of MIS.},

Both gastroenterologists with a surgical leaning and surgeons with advanced endoscopy interests are researching the feasibility of this new approach. Current flexible scopes and instruments are extremely limited for use in natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). We describe the development of an endoscopic system specifically designed for endoluminal and NOTES procedures and demonstrates benefits and efficacy in benchtop and cadaver models. Technique. In conjunction with industry, an 18-mm 4-channel rigidizing access device was designed. Measurements of the strength (torsional and lifting) of standard endoscopes and the new scope were made. The new device and instruments are used in 8 cadavers to document its feasibility in a variety of specific tasks: endoluminal plication, upper abdomen and lower abdomen visualization, bowel manipulation, solid organ retraction, cholecystectomy, and enterotomy closure. Results. Benchtop comparison between a standard scope and the new scope showed equal maneuverability but the newer scope had greater force delivery at the tip (0.042 vs 1.96 lb, P {\textless} .001) and greater instrument application force (0.09 vs 0.23 lb, P {\textless} .002). Introduction of the scope was possible in all cadavers but difficult in cadavers {\textless}60 kg. Intragastric manipulation was feasible and exiting the stomach was possible although it required a 2-cm gastrotomy. The scope system was maneuverable in both lower quadrants without difficulty. The upper abdomen was viewable, with variable success in steering the scope between left and right quadrants. The entire gastrointestinal tract was able to be visualized in most cadavers. The scope generated sufficient force to lift and manipulate intraabdominal structures. Cholecystectomy was successful in 5 of 5 attempts. Conclusion. A new flexible access endoscope with 4 large access channels showed utility in a cadaver model–satisfying some of the requirements for performance of NOTES procedures. 10.1177/1553350609334344},

	abstract = {Abstract A McKibben-type pneumatic actuator is widely used for utilization of its self-stabilization characteristics with a simple actuator model and a simple control method. However, how its characteristics act on the stability of robot motion have not been sufficiently discussed. The purpose of the paper is to analyze how various characteristics of McKibben pneumatic actuator (MPA) influence the stability of movements generated by MPA. In this paper, at first, we introduced two static models of the MPA which were proposed in the previous research and verified the models through validation experiments. The models of MPA form as simply as possible for a stability analysis. Next, we showed that the tension of MPA monotonically decreased according to the contraction velocity through validation experiments. Finally, the model was applied to a same simple robot model with the previous study and the stability of motions generated by the actuators was analyzed based on control theory. From the stability analysis, it was verified that the stability of the constant posture was achieved by the relatively simple static MPA model, the verified tension?velocity dependency of actuator, and the interaction with the properties of the actuator and the mechanical structure of the robot. This result suggests that the properties of MPA, particularly the verified velocity-dependent property, can contribute to the self-stability of a robot generated by the actuators, and it is important to consider the interaction between the mechanical structure and the actuator.},

	abstract = {The function of the engineering profession is to manipulate materials, energy, and information, thereby creating benefit for humankind. To do this successfully, engineers must have a knowledge of nature that goes beyond mere theoryâ€”knowledge that is traditionally gained in educational laboratories. Over the years, however, the nature of these laboratories has changed. This paper describes the history of some of these changes and explores in some depth a few of the major factors influencing laboratories today. In particular, the paper considers the lack of coherent learning objectives for laboratories and how this lack has limited the effectiveness of laboratories and hampered meaningful research in the area. A list of fundamental objectives is presented along with suggestions for possible future research.},
